# Email Notification System - Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented a comprehensive email notification system for all Stripe payment events in the JudgeFinder platform. The system provides automated, progressive dunning sequences, payment confirmations, and subscription lifecycle notifications.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Email Templates (`lib/email/templates.ts`)

Created 5 responsive HTML + text email templates:

- **Payment Success** - Confirms successful payment with invoice details
- **Payment Failed** - Alerts customers to payment failures with recovery instructions
- **Dunning Sequence** - Progressive urgency emails (Reminder → Urgent → Final)
- **Subscription Cancelled** - Confirms cancellation with reactivation option
- **Usage Report** - Monthly usage summary with metrics visualization

**Features:**

- Responsive design (mobile-friendly)
- Branded with JudgeFinder colors
- Both HTML and plain text versions
- Data-driven rendering
- Professional styling with inline CSS

### 2. Email Service (`lib/email/service.ts`)

Centralized service layer that:

- Fetches organization billing emails from database
- Renders templates with provided data
- Dispatches emails via SendGrid
- Logs all email attempts for auditing
- Handles errors gracefully

**Key Functions:**

```typescript
sendPaymentSuccessEmail(organizationId, data)
sendPaymentFailedEmail(organizationId, data)
sendDunningEmail(organizationId, data)
sendSubscriptionCancelledEmail(organizationId, data)
sendUsageReportEmail(organizationId, data)
```

### 3. Dunning Manager (`lib/email/dunning-manager.ts`)

Sophisticated payment recovery system:

- **Progressive Urgency**: Escalates from friendly reminder to final warning
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Prevents spam with time-throttling and severity tracking
- **Days Overdue Calculation**: Automatically determines email severity
- **Database Tracking**: Logs all dunning attempts with metadata

**Severity Levels:**

- Day 1-2: Reminder (friendly tone, yellow)
- Day 3-6: Urgent (strong CTA, orange)
- Day 7+: Final (last warning, red)

### 4. Webhook Integration

Updated webhook handlers to send emails:

**Organization Billing** (`lib/stripe/webhooks.ts`):

- `invoice.payment_succeeded` → Payment success email
- `invoice.payment_failed` → Payment failed + dunning email
- `customer.subscription.deleted` → Cancellation email

**Ad Subscriptions** (`app/api/webhooks/stripe/ad-subscriptions/route.ts`):

- `invoice.payment_failed` → Advertiser notification with ad details

### 5. Testing Infrastructure

Created comprehensive testing tools:

- **Manual Test Script** (`scripts/test-email-system.ts`)
- **Testing Documentation** (`docs/EMAIL_TESTING_GUIDE.md`)
- **System Documentation** (`docs/EMAIL_SYSTEM.md`)

## File Structure

├── service.ts             # Email sending service layer
├── mailer.ts              # SendGrid integration (existing, enhanced)

└── EMAIL_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md    # This file

scripts/
└── test-email-system.ts   # Manual testing script
```

## Environment Variables

Updated `.env.example` with:

```bash
# Email Service (SendGrid)
SENDGRID_API_KEY=SG.your_api_key_here
SENDGRID_FROM_EMAIL=billing@judgefinder.io
BILLING_FROM_EMAIL=noreply@judgefinder.io  # Fallback
```

## How It Works

### Payment Success Flow

```
1. Customer pays invoice successfully
2. Stripe sends invoice.payment_succeeded webhook
3. Webhook handler updates database (subscription status → active)
4. notifyPaymentSucceeded() called
5. sendPaymentSuccessEmail() renders template
6. Email sent via SendGrid
7. Log entry created in email_send_log table
```

### Payment Failure Flow

```
1. Customer payment fails
2. Stripe sends invoice.payment_failed webhook
3. Webhook handler updates database (subscription status → past_due)
4. notifyPaymentFailed() called
5. sendPaymentFailedEmail() sends immediate notification
6. sendDunningNotification() initiates dunning sequence
7. calculateDaysOverdue() determines severity
8. getDunningSeverity() returns 'reminder', 'urgent', or 'final'
9. sendDunningEmail() sends appropriate template
10. Email logged with metadata (severity, days overdue)
```

### Dunning Sequence Example

**Day 1:** First payment failure

- Email: "Reminder: Payment Overdue"
- Tone: Friendly reminder
- Color: Yellow/Warning

**Day 5:** Still unpaid (automatic check)

- Email: "Urgent: Payment Required"
- Tone: Stronger call to action
- Color: Orange/Alert

**Day 8:** Still unpaid (automatic check)

- Email: "Final Notice: Subscription Will Be Cancelled"
- Tone: Final warning
- Color: Red/Critical

## Setup Instructions

### 1. SendGrid Setup (Required for Production)

```bash
# 1. Create SendGrid account
# Visit: https://app.sendgrid.com/signup

# 2. Generate API key
# Navigate to: Settings → API Keys → Create API Key

# 3. Verify sender email
# Navigate to: Settings → Sender Authentication

# 4. Set environment variables
SENDGRID_API_KEY=SG.your_actual_api_key
SENDGRID_FROM_EMAIL=billing@judgefinder.io
```

### 2. Test Locally (Development)

```bash
# Without SendGrid (emails logged, not sent)
npm run dev

# Trigger test webhook
stripe trigger invoice.payment_succeeded

# Or use test script
npx tsx scripts/test-email-system.ts payment-success org_test123
```

### 3. Verify Email Logs

```sql
-- Check email send log
SELECT
  email_to,
  email_subject,
  status,
  metadata->>'category' as category,
  created_at
FROM email_send_log
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

## Testing

### Quick Test (All Email Types)

```bash
# Make sure you have a test organization with billing email
npx tsx scripts/test-email-system.ts all org_test123
```

### Individual Email Tests

```bash
# Payment success
npx tsx scripts/test-email-system.ts payment-success org_test123

# Payment failed
npx tsx scripts/test-email-system.ts payment-failed org_test123

# Dunning emails
npx tsx scripts/test-email-system.ts dunning-reminder org_test123
npx tsx scripts/test-email-system.ts dunning-urgent org_test123
npx tsx scripts/test-email-system.ts dunning-final org_test123

# Subscription cancelled
npx tsx scripts/test-email-system.ts subscription-cancelled org_test123

# Usage report
npx tsx scripts/test-email-system.ts usage-report org_test123
```

### Webhook Testing

```bash
# Install Stripe CLI
brew install stripe/stripe-cli/stripe

# Forward webhooks to local server
stripe listen --forward-to http://localhost:3000/api/webhooks/stripe

# In another terminal, trigger events
stripe trigger invoice.payment_succeeded
stripe trigger invoice.payment_failed
stripe trigger customer.subscription.deleted
```

## Key Features

### 1. Email Provider Flexibility

The system is built with abstraction layers, making it easy to swap email providers:

```typescript
// Current: SendGrid
// Can easily switch to: Resend, Postmark, AWS SES, etc.
// Only need to modify lib/email/mailer.ts
```

### 2. Test Mode Support

When `SENDGRID_API_KEY` is not configured:

- Emails are NOT sent
- All attempts logged to database
- Console shows email content (dev mode)
- No errors thrown

### 3. Progressive Dunning

Automatically escalates email urgency:

- Smart duplicate prevention
- Time-based throttling
- Severity tracking
- Database persistence

### 4. Audit Trail

Every email logged to `email_send_log` table:

- Recipient
- Subject
- Status (sent/error)
- Metadata (category, provider, etc.)
- Timestamp

### 5. Error Handling

Graceful degradation:

- Missing organization email → Log warning, skip email
- SendGrid failure → Log error, continue processing
- Template rendering error → Log error, use fallback
- All errors reported to Sentry

## Database Schema Used

### email_send_log Table

```sql
CREATE TABLE email_send_log (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id TEXT,
  email_to TEXT NOT NULL,
  email_subject TEXT NOT NULL,
  status TEXT CHECK (status IN ('sent', 'error')),
  metadata JSONB,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

**Metadata fields:**

- `provider`: 'sendgrid', 'none'
- `category`: 'payment-success', 'dunning-urgent', etc.
- `error`: Error message (if failed)

### organizations Table (Queried)

```sql
-- Required fields for email system:
- id (UUID)
- name (TEXT) - Used in email greeting
- billing_email (TEXT) - Recipient address
- subscription_status (TEXT) - For dunning eligibility
```

## Security Considerations

### Environment Variables

- API keys stored in Netlify/Vercel environment
- Never committed to version control
- Rotated quarterly (recommended)

### Email Content

- No sensitive data (passwords, full card numbers)
- All links use HTTPS protocol
- User data validated before inclusion

### Rate Limiting

- Dunning manager prevents spam
- Max 1 email per 24 hours per invoice
- Same severity sent only once

## Monitoring

### SendGrid Dashboard

- Deliverability metrics
- Open/click rates
- Bounce/spam complaints
- https://app.sendgrid.com/stats/overview

### Database Queries

```sql
-- Email volume by category (last 30 days)
SELECT
  metadata->>'category' as category,
  status,
  COUNT(*) as count
FROM email_send_log
WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days'
GROUP BY category, status;

-- Recent failures
SELECT *
FROM email_send_log
WHERE status = 'error'
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 20;
```

### Sentry Integration

- All email errors logged to Sentry
- Set up alerts for delivery failures
- Monitor error rates

## Cost Estimation

### SendGrid Pricing (Recommended Tier)

| Tier           | Monthly Emails        | Price  | Best For            |
| -------------- | --------------------- | ------ | ------------------- |
| **Free**       | 100/day (3,000/month) | $0     | Development/Testing |
| **Essentials** | 50,000/month          | $19.95 | Small scale         |
| **Pro**        | 100,000/month         | $89.95 | Growing businesses  |

### Estimated Usage (1,000 active subscriptions)

- Payment success: ~1,000/month
- Payment failed: ~50/month (5% failure rate)
- Dunning sequence: ~150/month (3 emails × 50 failures)
- Cancellations: ~20/month
- **Total: ~1,220 emails/month**

**Recommended:** Start with Free tier, upgrade to Essentials if needed.

## Future Enhancements

### 1. Scheduled Dunning Job

```typescript
// netlify/functions/scheduled-dunning.mts
export const handler = schedule('0 12 * * *', async () => {
  // Run daily at noon UTC
  // Process all past_due subscriptions
  // Send appropriate dunning emails
})
```

### 2. Email Preferences

- Allow users to opt out of certain emails
- Customize notification frequency
- Choose email vs. in-app notifications

### 3. Rich Templates

- Use React Email for template authoring
- Preview emails in development
- A/B testing for subject lines

### 4. Analytics Dashboard

- Email open/click rates
- Conversion metrics (dunning → payment)
- Deliverability trends

### 5. Localization

- Multi-language support
- Currency formatting by locale
- Date/time formatting

## Troubleshooting

### Emails Not Sending

1. **Check environment variables**

   ```bash
   echo $SENDGRID_API_KEY
   echo $SENDGRID_FROM_EMAIL
   ```

2. **Verify SendGrid API key**

   ```bash
   curl -X GET https://api.sendgrid.com/v3/user/email \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer $SENDGRID_API_KEY"
   ```

3. **Check email logs**
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM email_send_log
   WHERE status = 'error'
   ORDER BY created_at DESC;
   ```

### Duplicate Emails

1. Check dunning prevention: `shouldSendDunningEmail()`
2. Review webhook logs for duplicate events
3. Verify invoice metadata tracking

### Template Issues

1. Validate HTML: https://validator.w3.org/
2. Test in email clients (Gmail, Outlook, Apple Mail)
3. Check responsive design on mobile
