## Deployment Process

### Before Deploying

1. **Create a backup**
   ```bash
   # Backup database
   # (Use your Supabase dashboard or CLI to create a backup)
   ```

2. **Run pre-deployment tests**
   ```bash
   npm run test
   npm run type-check
   npm run lint
   ```

3. **Verify environment variables**
   ```bash
   node -e "require('./lib/utils/env-validator').validateEnvironmentOnStartup()"
   ```

4. **Review changes**
   ```bash
   git log --oneline main..HEAD
   git diff main
   ```

### During Deployment

1. **Deploy to production**
   ```bash
   git push origin main
   # Or use Netlify CLI: netlify deploy --prod
   ```

2. **Monitor build logs**
   - Watch Netlify dashboard for build progress
   - Check for any build errors or warnings

3. **Wait for deployment to complete**
   - Netlify will provide a deploy URL
   - Verify build completed successfully

### After Deployment

1. **Run deployment verification**
   ```bash
   DEPLOY_URL=https://judgefinder.io ./scripts/verify-deployment.sh
   ```

2. **Manual smoke testing**
   - [ ] Visit homepage
   - [ ] Perform a search
   - [ ] View a judge profile
   - [ ] Check court listings
   - [ ] Test authentication (sign in/out)
   - [ ] Verify mobile responsiveness

3. **Check monitoring tools**
   - [ ] Sentry: No new errors
   - [ ] Google Analytics: Tracking events
   - [ ] Server logs: No critical errors
   - [ ] Health check endpoint: Returns healthy

4. **Verify performance**
   ```bash
   curl -o /dev/null -s -w "Response time: %{time_total}s\n" https://judgefinder.io/api/health
   ```

5. **Run production smoke tests**
   ```bash
   PROD_URL=https://judgefinder.io npx playwright test tests/smoke/production.spec.ts
   ```

## Post-Deployment Monitoring

### First Hour

- [ ] Monitor error rates in Sentry
- [ ] Check server response times
- [ ] Verify user traffic is flowing normally
- [ ] Watch for any spike in errors
- [ ] Check database connection pool
- [ ] Monitor memory usage

### First 24 Hours

- [ ] Review analytics for traffic patterns
- [ ] Check for any user-reported issues
- [ ] Monitor API rate limits
- [ ] Verify scheduled jobs running correctly
- [ ] Review server logs for anomalies

### First Week

- [ ] Analyze performance metrics
- [ ] Review user feedback
- [ ] Check for any edge cases or bugs
- [ ] Verify all integrations working smoothly

## Rollback Procedure

If critical issues are detected after deployment:

1. **Immediate rollback via Netlify**
   - Go to Netlify dashboard â†’ Deploys
   - Find the previous working deploy
   - Click "Publish deploy" to rollback

2. **Investigate the issue**
   - Check Sentry for error details
   - Review server logs
   - Reproduce the issue locally

3. **Fix and redeploy**
   - Create a hotfix branch
   - Fix the issue
   - Test thoroughly
   - Deploy again following this checklist
