# Agent Context Overview

## Mission Snapshot

- Deliver AI-powered judicial transparency for California courts while preparing for multi-state expansion.
- Maintain high data quality (≥500 cases per judge) and enforce strict court assignment validation.
- Provide trustworthy bias analytics, search intelligence, and professional integrations.

## Core System Pillars

### Judicial Data Processing

- Multi-stage judge-case matching with jurisdiction awareness.
- Position history tracking with retirement detection.
- Bias pattern analysis via `lib/analytics/bias-calculations.ts`.
- Court assignment validation with conflict prevention.

### Legal Search & Discovery

- AI-assisted search intent detection using `lib/ai/search-intelligence.ts`.
- Domain-aware ranking with case volume and experience factors.
- Court hierarchy filters and answer engine optimizations.

### Professional Integration

- Tiered ad pricing with jurisdiction controls (`lib/ads/service.ts`).
- Bar number verification workflows.
- Court-specific ad placement compliance.
- Notifications and iOS widget integrations for case tracking.

## Agent Operating Guidelines

- Touch only code relevant to the request; keep functionality intact elsewhere.
- Provide full implementations (no placeholders) with OOP-oriented structure.
- Break work into reasoned steps and document observations before conclusions.
- Add logging when diagnosing issues; remove or gate noisy logs afterwards.
- Respect file size rules (≤500 lines); split modules before they grow large.
- Organize logic using ViewModels/Managers/Coordinators when applicable.
- Keep functions ≤40 lines and classes focused on single responsibilities.
- Use descriptive naming; avoid vague terms like `data` or `helper`.

## Domain Models

- **Judge Profile Management:** Positions, case assignments, bias indicators, background verification.
- **Court Organization:** Hierarchies, type classifications, assignment conflict resolution, geography mapping.
- **Case Analytics:** Outcome detection, settlement analysis, timeline metrics, practice area clustering.

## Foundational Business Rules

1. **Judge Data Validation:** ≥500 cases, active positions only, no multi-jurisdiction conflicts, preserve history.
2. **Court Assignment Logic:** One active position per court, enforce jurisdiction bounds, prevent temporal overlap, validate transitions.
3. **Analytics Generation:** Require sufficient sample sizes, confidence intervals, bias significance checks, timeline normalization.

## Development Guidelines

- Only modify code directly relevant to the specific request. Avoid changing unrelated functionality.
- Never replace code with placeholders like `# ... rest of the processing ...`. Always include complete code.
- Break problems into smaller steps. Think through each step separately before implementing.
- Always provide a complete PLAN with REASONING based on evidence from code and logs before making changes.
- Explain your OBSERVATIONS clearly, then provide REASONING to identify the exact issue. Add console logs when needed to gather more information.
