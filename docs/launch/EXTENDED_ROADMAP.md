# JudgeFinder Extended Roadmap (6–12 Months)

## Context and Current Baseline
- Recovery deliverables (`AGENT_SWARM_SUMMARY.md`) confirm core platform stability targets and operational readiness.
- Search modernization roadmap (`docs/search/SEARCH_COMPARISON_ANALYSIS.md`) currently stops after PostgreSQL optimization and Elasticsearch migration plans.
- Analytics foundations (`lib/analytics/bias-calculations.ts`) already produce bias indicators, settlement trends, and temporal patterns that enable richer insights.
- Onboarding program (`ONBOARDING_ENHANCEMENTS_SUMMARY.md`) includes future enhancements placeholders but lacks concrete scheduling.

## Horizon Themes
1. Platform Stability and Observability
2. Data Enrichment and Coverage Expansion
3. AI-Assisted Discovery and Insights
4. Professional Ecosystem Integration

## 0–3 Month Objectives

### Platform Stability and Observability
- **Objective:** Complete recovery execution and establish proactive monitoring.
- **Initiatives:**
  - Execute recovery phases A–C, then automate via `scripts/emergency-recovery.*` (ref. `AGENT_SWARM_SUMMARY.md`).
  - Configure Sentry, UptimeRobot, and Netlify Analytics dashboards with alert thresholds.
  - Capture baseline metrics (error rate, response time) and publish weekly status reports.
- **KPIs:**
  - Error rate <1%; uptime ≥ 99.5%; mean homepage latency < 1.5s.

### Data Enrichment and Coverage Expansion
- **Objective:** Harden California dataset and prepare for multi-state intake.
- **Initiatives:**
  - Finish PostgreSQL Phase 1 search optimization tasks (indexes, materialized views).
  - Build judge data validation suite enforcing 500-case minimum and position integrity.
  - Design ingestion contracts for Nevada and Arizona (schema extensions, jurisdiction mapping).
- **KPIs:**
  - Search latency <200ms for CA queries; ≥95% judges meeting data completeness thresholds.

### AI-Assisted Discovery and Insights
- **Objective:** Productionize Gemini-backed natural language search basics.
- **Initiatives:**
  - Harden `processNaturalLanguageQuery` fallbacks and observability (logging, rate controls).
  - Surface AI intent metadata within UI search results (intent badges, suggested filters).
  - Pilot conversational answer snippets for top 10 search intents.
- **KPIs:**
  - ≥30% of searches use AI-expanded terms; AI fallback error rate <5%.

### Professional Ecosystem Integration
- **Objective:** Tighten compliance and payment readiness.
- **Initiatives:**
  - Finalize tiered advertising pricing matrices (refine `lib/ads/service.ts` inputs).
  - Complete bar verification workflows for California Bar API.
  - Ship environment variable automation (Netlify CLI scripts) to reduce setup time.
- **KPIs:**
  - Ads compliance checks automated; bar verification success rate ≥98%.

## 3–6 Month Objectives

### Platform Stability and Observability
- Implement canary deploys with automated rollback triggers.
- Build incident response runbooks with postmortem templates in `docs/operations/`.
- Introduce synthetic transaction monitoring for judge search, comparison, analytics pages.

### Data Enrichment and Coverage Expansion
- Launch initial multi-state support (NV, AZ) with jurisdiction hierarchy and conflict checks.
- Develop automated anomaly detection for case volume and settlement rates using Supabase functions.
- Publish public API documentation for partner ingestion (create `docs/api/partners` set).

### AI-Assisted Discovery and Insights
- Roll out Phase 2 search features (facets, “did you mean”, highlighting) from existing roadmap.
- Train bias trend alerts leveraging `BiasIndicators` for temporal shifts and push notifications.
- Integrate AI-generated judge summaries gated behind professional tier (tie into dashboard).

### Professional Ecosystem Integration
- Add subscription management dashboard with usage analytics for firms.
- Expand notification channels (SMS, email digests) with quiet-hour controls.
- Establish compliance reviews for jurisdiction-based ad placements.

## 6–12 Month Objectives

### Platform Stability and Observability
- Transition to infrastructure-as-code for Netlify/Supabase configuration with audit trails.
- Implement cross-region redundancy and database failover testing regimen.
- Achieve SOC 2 readiness checklist completion (document gaps, schedule audits).

### Data Enrichment and Coverage Expansion
- Generalize ingestion pipeline for nationwide rollout (court hierarchy templates, normalization).
- Introduce bias benchmarking across jurisdictions with comparative analytics dashboards.
- Launch case outcome prediction models leveraging historical timelines and case value trends.

### AI-Assisted Discovery and Insights
- Complete Elasticsearch migration (Phase 3) with A/B testing against PostgreSQL baseline.
- Deliver conversational research assistant integrating Gemini responses with curated citations.
- Provide customizable AI alerts for judge behavior changes and docket activity spikes.

### Professional Ecosystem Integration
- Open partner integrations marketplace with documented webhooks and SDKs.
- Offer premium analytics packages (white-label exports, API quotas) tied to jurisdiction-based pricing.
- Deploy court-specific ad targeting controlled by compliance rule engine enhancements.

## Dependencies and Sequencing
- **Recovery foundation** (0–3 months) prerequisite for canary deploys and multi-state data.
- **Search Phase 2** depends on Phase 1 PostgreSQL tasks; Elasticsearch migration depends on both.
- **Bias alerting** requires stabilized analytics pipelines and extended jurisdiction coverage.
- **Marketplace and premium analytics** hinge on subscription management and API documentation rollouts.

## Measurement and Governance
- Establish quarterly OKR reviews aligned to themes; log outcomes in `docs/operations/roadmap-review.md`.
- Maintain KPI dashboards in admin analytics panel; expose executive snapshot via `/admin/roadmap`.
- Schedule cross-functional roadmap sync every 6 weeks with Managers (Data, AI, Professional Integration).
