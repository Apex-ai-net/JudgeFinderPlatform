- ‚úÖ Federal appellate judges
- ‚úÖ Federal district judges
- ‚úÖ Supreme Court justices
- ‚úÖ State supreme court justices (many states)
- ‚úÖ State appellate judges (many states)

**Limited Coverage**:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è State trial court judges (varies by state)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Magistrate judges
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Special court judges
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Historical judges (pre-1950)

**California-Specific**:
- ‚úÖ CA Supreme Court: Excellent coverage
- ‚úÖ CA Courts of Appeal: Good coverage
- ‚ö†Ô∏è CA Superior Courts: Limited coverage (many judges lack data)

### Our Integration

**Sync Manager**: `/lib/courtlistener/political-affiliation-sync.ts`

**Data Flow**:
1. Query judges with `courtlistener_id` from our database
2. For each judge, fetch political affiliations from CourtListener
3. Format affiliation text: `"Republican Party (2018-present, appointed by Trump)"`
4. Store in `judges.political_affiliation` column
5. Optionally store full JSON in `judges.courtlistener_data` JSONB field

**Formatting Logic**:
```typescript
// Simple format (default):
"Republican Party (2018-present, appointed by Trump)"

// With history (--history flag):
"Republican Party (2018-present, Trump); Republican Party (2003-2018, Bush)"
```

**Error Handling**:
- Missing affiliation data: Skip judge (common for state trial judges)
- API errors: Log and continue to next judge
- Rate limit exceeded: Wait for hourly reset
- Invalid response: Log error details and skip judge

### Example Usage

**Sync Script**:
```bash
# Sync political affiliations for all judges missing data
npm run sync:political

# Force re-sync all judges (catch party changes)
npm run sync:political -- --all

# Test with limited batch
npm run sync:political -- --limit=50

# Include full historical affiliations in JSONB field
npm run sync:political -- --history
```

**Direct API Call**:
```typescript
import { CourtListenerClient } from '@/lib/courtlistener/client'

const client = new CourtListenerClient()
const affiliations = await client.getPoliticalAffiliations('12345')

console.log(affiliations)
// PoliticalAffiliationResponse with results array
```

## California Secretary of State

### Overview

The California Secretary of State oversees all elections in California and publishes official election results, candidate information, and campaign finance data.

**Website**: https://www.sos.ca.gov/elections
**Status**: Planned integration (Phase 2)

### Available Data

- Vote percentage
- Geographic breakdown (by county)
- Ballot measures related to judicial races

**URL Pattern**:
```
https://elections.cdn.sos.ca.gov/sov/[YEAR]-[ELECTION]/[COUNTY]-sov.pdf
```

**Example**:
```
https://elections.cdn.sos.ca.gov/sov/2022-general/los-angeles-sov.pdf
```

**Format**: PDF
**Availability**: Pre-election (60 days before election)

**Data Includes**:
- Biographical information
- Educational background
- Professional experience
- Candidate's statement (up to 400 words)

**URL Pattern**:
```
https://voterguide.sos.ca.gov/[YEAR]/[ELECTION]/pdf/candidate-statements/[POSITION].pdf
```

#### 3. Campaign Finance (Form 460)

**Database**: http://cal-access.sos.ca.gov/

### Integration Plan (Phase 2)

**Timeline**: Q2 2026 (before November 2026 elections)

**Approach**:
1. **Manual Import**: Initial historical data entry
   - Scrape PDFs for past election results (2020, 2022, 2024)
   - OCR and validate data
   - Import into `judge_elections` table

2. **Automated Import**: Post-election results
   - Monitor SOS website for new election data
   - Parse CSV files when available
   - Validate against existing records
   - Automatically populate `judge_elections` table

3. **Real-time API** (if available):
   - Investigate if SOS offers real-time election night API
   - If yes, integrate for live results
   - If no, continue with post-election CSV parsing

**Data Mapping**:

| SOS Field | JudgeFinder Field |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Candidate Name | `judge_id` (lookup) |
| Office | `position_sought` |
| Votes Received | `vote_count` |
| Percent of Votes | `vote_percentage` |
| Election Date | `election_date` |
| County | `jurisdiction` |

**Challenges**:
- No standardized API (manual parsing required)
- PDF formats vary by county
- Candidate name matching (need fuzzy matching)
- Historical data requires manual data entry
- Budget: ~60 hours of development time

## Data Quality Considerations

### Data Completeness

**CourtListener Coverage by Court Level**:

| Court Level | Data Completeness | Notes |
|-------------|-------------------|-------|
| US Supreme Court | 100% | Complete historical data |
| Federal Appellate | 95% | Nearly complete |
| Federal District | 90% | Very good coverage |
| State Supreme Court | 80% | Good for major states |
| State Appellate | 60% | Varies significantly by state |
| State Trial Court | 30% | **Limited coverage** |

**California-Specific**:
- CA Supreme Court: 100% (all justices have affiliation data)
- CA Courts of Appeal: 85% (most justices covered)
- CA Superior Courts: **25%** (many judges lack data)

**Implication for JudgeFinder**:
- Expect ~75% of judges to have political affiliation data
- ~25% will show "Unknown" or "No affiliation data available"
- This is normal and expected

### Data Accuracy

**CourtListener Data Quality**:
- ‚úÖ **High accuracy** for federal judges (sourced from Senate records)
- ‚úÖ **High accuracy** for appointment data (official records)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Medium accuracy** for state judges (varies by state)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Low accuracy** for historical data pre-1950

**Common Data Issues**:
1. **Stale Data**: Judges may have changed party affiliation
   - Solution: Monthly re-sync
2. **Missing End Dates**: Some historical affiliations lack end dates
   - Solution: Mark as "historical" if start_date > 20 years ago
3. **Duplicate Records**: Multiple affiliation records for same period
   - Solution: De-duplicate by preferring most recent record

### Data Consistency

**Cross-Source Validation**:

When California SOS data becomes available, validate CourtListener data:

```sql
-- Flag inconsistencies for manual review
SELECT
  je.judge_id,
  j.name,
  je.election_date,
  je.source_name,
  j.political_affiliation as cl_affiliation,
  je.notes as sos_notes
FROM judge_elections je
JOIN judges j ON j.id = je.judge_id
WHERE je.source_name = 'CA Secretary of State'
  AND j.political_affiliation IS NOT NULL
  AND j.political_affiliation NOT ILIKE '%' || je.election_type || '%'
```

**Conflict Resolution Policy**:
1. Official government sources (SOS) take precedence over CourtListener
2. Most recent data preferred
3. Flag conflicts for manual review
4. Document source in `source_name` field

---

## Update Frequency & Sync Schedule

### Political Affiliation Data

**Source**: CourtListener API

**Sync Schedule**:
- **Initial Sync**: One-time bulk import (~1,600 judges, 90 minutes)
- **Weekly Incremental**: New judges only (Sunday 2 AM PT)
- **Monthly Full Re-sync**: All judges to catch party changes (1st Sunday, 3 AM PT)

**Cron Job**:
```bash
# Weekly incremental (new judges)
0 2 * * 0 npm run sync:political >> /var/log/political-sync.log 2>&1

# Monthly full re-sync
0 3 1-7 * 0 npm run sync:political -- --all >> /var/log/political-resync.log 2>&1
```

### Election Results Data

**Source**: CA Secretary of State (future)

**Sync Schedule**:
- **Post-Election**: Manually import certified results (within 30 days)
- **Historical**: Annual refresh of past election data
- **Real-time** (if API available): Election night results every 15 minutes

### Manual Data Entry

**Process**:
1. Research judge on official sources
2. Validate information with at least 2 sources
3. Enter data via admin interface
4. Mark as `verified = TRUE`
5. Document sources in `source_name` and `source_url` fields

**Quality Control**:
- All manual entries require peer review
- Mark with `source_name = 'Manual Entry - [Name]'`
- Include link to source document in `source_url`

---

## Data Accuracy & Verification

### Verification Levels

We use a 3-tier verification system:

#### Tier 1: Verified ‚úÖ

**Criteria**:
- Data from official government source (SOS, FEC, Senate)
- Manually reviewed and confirmed
- Multiple source agreement
- Recent (within 2 years)

**Database Field**: `verified = TRUE`

**Display**: Show verification badge

#### Tier 2: Sourced üìã

**Criteria**:
- Data from reputable third-party (CourtListener, Ballotpedia)
- Automated sync
- Single source
- Date unknown

**Database Field**: `verified = FALSE`, `source_name` populated

**Display**: Show source attribution

#### Tier 3: Unverified ‚ö†Ô∏è

**Criteria**:
- Data completeness < 50%
- Source questionable or missing
- Conflicts between sources
- Very old data (> 20 years)

**Database Field**: `verified = FALSE`, `source_name = NULL`

**Display**: Show disclaimer "Unverified data"

### Verification Workflow

```sql
-- Weekly verification audit
SELECT
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE verified = TRUE) as verified_count,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE verified = FALSE AND source_name IS NOT NULL) as sourced_count,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE source_name IS NULL) as unverified_count,
  ROUND(100.0 * COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE verified = TRUE) / COUNT(*), 2) as verified_percentage
FROM judge_elections;

-- Flag old unverified data for review
SELECT id, judge_id, election_date, source_name
FROM judge_elections
WHERE verified = FALSE
  AND election_date < CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '5 years'
ORDER BY election_date DESC;
```

### User-Facing Verification Indicators

**Component**: `ElectionInformation.tsx`

```typescript
// Show verification badge for verified elections
{election.verified && (
  <Badge variant="success">
    <CheckCircle className="h-3 w-3" />
    Verified
  </Badge>
)}

// Show source for sourced data
{!election.verified && election.source_name && (
  <span className="text-xs text-muted-foreground">
    Source: {election.source_name}
  </span>
)}

// Show disclaimer for unverified
{!election.verified && !election.source_name && (
  <Alert variant="warning">
    <AlertCircle className="h-4 w-4" />
    <AlertDescription>
      Unverified election data. Please verify with official sources.
    </AlertDescription>
  </Alert>
)}
```

### Recommended Strategy

**Current** (Phase 1):
- Primary: CourtListener for political affiliations
- Fallback: Manual entry for missing data

**Near-term** (Phase 2):
- Primary: CourtListener (political affiliations)
- Secondary: CA SOS (official election results)
- Manual entry for gaps

**Long-term** (Phase 3):
- Primary: CourtListener (political affiliations)
- Secondary: CA SOS (election results)
- Tertiary: Ballotpedia (enrichment data)
- Manual entry for corrections
