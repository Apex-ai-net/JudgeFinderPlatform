## What Are Judicial Elections?

### California's Dual Selection System

California uses **different methods** for selecting judges depending on the court level:

#### Superior Court Judges (Trial Courts)

**Selection Method**: Elected by voters

- **Nonpartisan Elections**: Candidates' political parties are NOT shown on the ballot
- **Term Length**: 6 years
- **Vacancies**: Governor appoints, appointee serves until next election
- **Process**: Competitive elections with multiple candidates (unless unopposed)

**Example**:
> "Hon. Jane Smith was elected to the Superior Court of Los Angeles County in 2020 with 62% of the vote. Her term expires in 2026."

#### Appellate & Supreme Court Justices

**Selection Method**: Appointed by Governor, confirmed by voters

- **Initial Appointment**: Governor appoints from judicial nominating commission
- **Commission on Judicial Appointments**: Reviews nominee (Supreme Court only)
- **Retention Elections**: Yes/No vote by public (no opposing candidates)
- **Term Length**: 12 years
- **Retention Threshold**: Must receive majority "Yes" votes to stay in office

**Example**:
> "Justice John Doe was appointed by Governor Brown in 2015 and retained by voters in 2018 with 67% approval. His next retention election is in 2030."

### Types of Judicial Elections

#### 1. Nonpartisan Elections

**What it is**: Competitive election without party labels on ballot

**Common for**: Superior Court judges

**What you'll see**:
- Multiple candidates running for same position
- Candidate statements and qualifications
- Vote tallies and percentages

**Example ballot language**:
```
Superior Court Judge, Office No. 42

Vote for One:

[ ] Jane Smith
[ ] John Doe
[ ] Maria Garcia
```

#### 2. Retention Elections

**What it is**: Yes/No vote on whether to keep a sitting judge

**Common for**: Appellate and Supreme Court justices

**What you'll see**:
- Single judge's name
- Yes or No vote
- Historical approval percentages

**Example ballot language**:
```
Shall Justice Jane Smith be retained as
Associate Justice of the Court of Appeal?

[ ] Yes
[ ] No
```

#### 3. Competitive Elections

**What it is**: Multiple candidates running for open seat or against incumbent

**Common for**: Superior Court vacancies

**What you'll see**:
- Candidate biographies
- Endorsements
- Campaign finance data (future feature)

### Why Judicial Elections Matter

**Impact on Your Life**:
- Judges decide cases affecting your rights, property, and freedom
- Judicial philosophy affects legal interpretations
- Retention votes are accountability mechanisms
- Your vote determines who interprets California law

**Low Voter Participation Problem**:
- Many voters skip judicial races due to lack of information
- Retention elections often see 20-30% drop-off from top-of-ticket races
- Informed voting requires research (this is where JudgeFinder helps!)

### Understanding Election History Timeline

Each election entry shows:

1. **Date & Type**: When election occurred and type (retention, competitive, etc.)
2. **Position Sought**: Specific seat or office
3. **Result**: Won or Lost (with badge)
4. **Vote Percentage**: Share of votes received
5. **Total Votes**: Number of votes received
6. **Opponents**: Other candidates and their vote shares (if competitive)
7. **Incumbent Status**: Whether judge was running for re-election

### Reading Vote Percentages

**Retention Elections**:
- Percentage = % of "Yes" votes
- Example: 67.5% means 67.5% voted "Yes" to retain, 32.5% voted "No"
- Passing threshold: Usually 50% (majority)

**Competitive Elections**:
- Percentage = % of total votes received
- Example: 62.3% in 3-candidate race means strong victory
- Winning threshold: Plurality (most votes, not necessarily 50%)

**What's a good percentage?**
- **Retention**: 60%+ is strong approval, 50-60% is moderate, <50% means not retained
- **Competitive**: 50%+ is strong (especially in multi-candidate race), 40-50% is competitive, <40% suggests weak support

## Frequently Asked Questions

### General Questions

**Q: Are judicial elections partisan or nonpartisan?**

A: It depends on the court level:
- **Superior Court elections**: Nonpartisan (party not on ballot)
- **Retention elections**: Nonpartisan (yes/no vote, no party labels)
- **Historically**: Some states have partisan judicial elections, but not California

**Q: How often are judicial elections held?**

A: Varies by position:
- **Superior Court**: Every 6 years (with term)
- **Appellate Courts**: Every 12 years (retention elections)
- **Supreme Court**: Every 12 years (retention elections)
- **Vacancies**: Special elections to fill unexpired terms

**Q: What's the difference between appointed and elected judges?**

A:
- **Appointed**: Selected by Governor (state) or President (federal), subject to retention vote
- **Elected**: Chosen by voters in competitive election
- **Impact**: Appointed judges may face less political pressure but have less direct accountability to voters

### Using JudgeFinder

**Q: Why doesn't this judge have political affiliation data?**

A: Several reasons:
- Judge was elected in nonpartisan election (party not recorded)
- Judge hasn't disclosed party affiliation
- Data not yet available from CourtListener
- Trial court judges often lack this data

**Note**: Absence of data doesn't mean judge is nonpartisan, just that we don't have that information.

**Q: How current is the election data?**

A:
- **Political affiliations**: Synced weekly from CourtListener
- **Election results**: Added after official certification (usually 30 days post-election)
- **Upcoming elections**: Updated as announced by Secretary of State
- Last updated date shown on each judge profile

**Q: Can I download election data?**

A: Currently, data is view-only through the website. API access is available for researchers and organizations. Contact us for access.

**Q: How do I report incorrect election information?**

A: Use the "Report Issue" button on judge's profile page, or email support@judgefinder.io with:
- Judge's name
- Incorrect information
- Correct information (with source)
- Your contact information

### Understanding Election Data

**Q: What does "appointed by [Name]" mean?**

A: Indicates which Governor or President appointed the judge to their position. Appointments are part of public record and provide context about judge's political background.

**Q: Why do some retention elections show very high approval rates?**

A: Retention elections typically have high approval rates (70-80%+) because:
- Voters generally approve of sitting judges
- No opposing candidate highlighting weaknesses
- Low voter awareness/engagement in judicial races
- Campaign against judge requires significant effort

**Q: What's considered a "low" retention percentage?**

A: Historical context:
- **70%+**: Strong approval
- **60-70%**: Moderate approval
- **50-60%**: Concerning (indicates significant opposition)
- **<50%**: Not retained (rare but happens)

**Q: How do I know if a competitive election was close?**

A: Look at vote margins:
- **>60%**: Landslide victory
- **55-60%**: Strong victory
- **50-55%**: Competitive victory
- **<50%**: Plurality win (3+ candidates, no majority)

### Voting and Civic Engagement

**Q: Should I vote "Yes" on all retention elections?**

A: Not necessarily. Use JudgeFinder to research:
- Judge's case record
- Past retention percentages
- Any controversies or disciplinary actions
- Performance metrics (reversal rate, etc.)

Make informed decision based on judge's performance, not just default approval.

**Q: Where can I find official candidate statements?**

A: Click "California Voter Guide" link in Voter Resources section, or visit:
- [voterguide.sos.ca.gov](https://voterguide.sos.ca.gov)
- Your county's election website
- Official voter information pamphlet (mailed to you)

**Q: Can I vote for multiple judges in one election?**

A: Yes, if multiple positions are on the ballot. Each judicial position is a separate race. You can vote for one candidate per position.

### Understanding California's Judicial Selection System

#### History of Judicial Selection

California's current system is a **modified Missouri Plan**:

1. **Before 1934**: All judges elected in partisan elections
2. **1934 Reform**: Created nonpartisan Superior Court elections
3. **1966 Reform**: Introduced retention elections for appellate courts
4. **Current System**: Hybrid of elections and appointments

#### Why This System?

**Goals**:
- **Independence**: Reduce political pressure on judges
- **Accountability**: Allow voters to remove underperforming judges
- **Quality**: Ensure qualified candidates through merit selection

**Trade-offs**:
- **Less democratic**: Appointed judges not directly chosen by voters
- **More stable**: Judges serve longer terms without constant campaigning
- **Mixed accountability**: Retention votes are less competitive than full elections

### Types of Selection Methods by State

California's system is unique. How do other states do it?

| Method | States | Pros | Cons |
|--------|--------|------|------|
| **Partisan Election** | 7 states | Most democratic | Most politicized |
| **Nonpartisan Election** | 15 states (including CA for trial courts) | Democratic, less partisan | Still political pressure |
| **Gubernatorial Appointment** | 3 states | Merit-based | Least accountable |
| **Legislative Appointment** | 2 states (VA, SC) | Collaborative | Highly political |
| **Missouri Plan (Merit Selection + Retention)** | 16 states (including CA for appellate) | Balance quality & accountability | Complex, less direct |

**California uses**: Nonpartisan election (Superior Courts) + Missouri Plan (Appellate/Supreme)

### Key Dates in California Judicial Elections

**Election Cycle**:
- **Filing deadline**: 158 days before election
- **Primary election**: First Tuesday after first Monday in March (presidential years)
- **General election**: First Tuesday after first Monday in November
- **Runoff**: If no candidate gets 50%+ in primary, top two advance to general

**Important Dates**:
- **Voter registration deadline**: 15 days before election
- **Early voting**: Starts 29 days before election
- **Election Day**: First Tuesday of November (even-numbered years)

### Judicial Campaign Rules

**What judges CAN do**:
- State their qualifications
- Describe their judicial philosophy
- Respond to candidate questionnaires
- Appear at public forums

**What judges CANNOT do** (Code of Judicial Ethics):
- Make promises about future rulings
- Commit to decide cases in a particular way
- Solicit campaign contributions directly (must use committee)
- Endorse partisan political candidates

**Why these rules?**
- Preserve judicial impartiality
- Avoid appearance of bias
- Maintain public confidence in courts
