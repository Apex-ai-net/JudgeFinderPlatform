## üîß Technical Debt & Improvements

### Code Quality
- ‚úÖ All iOS code follows OOP principles
- ‚úÖ Singleton patterns for managers
- ‚úÖ Proper separation of concerns
- ‚úÖ TypeScript throughout

### Testing Needs
- ‚è≥ Unit tests for iOS managers
- ‚è≥ Integration tests for deep linking
- ‚è≥ E2E tests for push notifications
- ‚è≥ Widget rendering tests

### Performance
- ‚úÖ Lazy loading of iOS modules
- ‚úÖ Conditional imports based on platform
- ‚è≥ Need to test app performance on device
- ‚è≥ Monitor memory usage in production

## üìù Notes & Considerations

### Development Environment
- Current dev machine may not have Xcode installed
- iOS development requires macOS with Xcode 15+
- Physical iPhone device recommended for final testing
- Apple Developer account ($99/year) required for distribution

### App Review Risks
- **4.2 Risk (Minimum Functionality)**: Mitigated by 3 native features
- **Sign in with Apple**: Required if we have any social login
- **Privacy Details**: Must be thoroughly completed
- **Reviewer Notes**: Critical to explain native features clearly

### Production Considerations
- APNs certificates must be renewed annually
- Push notification service needs monitoring
- Widget data should be cached efficiently
- Deep links must handle all edge cases

## üéâ What We've Achieved

Starting from zero iOS knowledge, we've:
1. ‚úÖ Designed complete iOS app architecture
2. ‚úÖ Implemented robust native bridges
3. ‚úÖ Created clean React integration layer
4. ‚úÖ Built backend API infrastructure
5. ‚úÖ Prepared database schema
6. ‚úÖ Written comprehensive documentation
7. ‚úÖ Set up development workflow

**The foundation is solid. The remaining work is execution.**
