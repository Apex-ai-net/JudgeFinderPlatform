}
```

### Action Plan

Before production deployment:

1. **Fix case count drift (Required)**
   ```bash
   npm run cleanup-production-data -- --force
   ```
   Expected result: 15 judge case counts recalculated

2. **Generate missing analytics (Recommended)**
   ```bash
   npm run batch-generate-analytics
   ```
   Expected result: 8 new analytics records created

3. **Re-run validation (Required)**
   ```bash
   npm run validate-production-data
   ```
   Expected result: All checks pass

4. **Review stale data (Optional)**
   ```bash
   npm run sync:judges
   ```
   Expected result: 45 judge records refreshed

### Conclusion

**Deployment Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNINGS - Review Recommended

The platform has 3 issues requiring attention before production deployment:
- 1 high priority issue (case count drift)
- 2 medium priority issues (stale data, missing analytics)

All critical validations passed. The high priority issue can be automatically fixed using the cleanup script. After addressing these issues and re-running validation, the platform will be ready for production deployment.

**Estimated time to resolve:** 15 minutes
**Next validation scheduled:** After fixes applied
