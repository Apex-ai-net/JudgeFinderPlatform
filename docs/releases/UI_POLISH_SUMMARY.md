## 🎨 Design Philosophy

### Cohesion
Every component uses the same design system foundation. Colors, spacing, typography, and animations all follow consistent patterns.

### Performance
All animations are GPU-accelerated and respect user preferences. CSS containment and lazy loading ensure smooth performance even on older devices.

### Accessibility
Meeting WCAG 2.1 AA standards isn't optional—it's built into every component. Touch targets, contrast ratios, and keyboard navigation are first-class concerns.

### Mobile-First
Touch targets meet the 44px minimum. Animations feel snappy on mobile. Navigation is optimized for thumb reach.

### Dark Mode Native
Not an afterthought—dark mode uses semantic tokens throughout. Every component looks great in both themes.
