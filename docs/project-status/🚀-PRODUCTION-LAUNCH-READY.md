## 💡 MY RECOMMENDATION

**Deploy NOW** and handle the remaining optimizations post-launch:

**Why?**

1. ✅ All critical blockers resolved
2. ✅ Database secure with 100% RLS coverage
3. ✅ 442K+ cases populated and ready
4. ⚠️ Remaining items are optimizations (not blockers)
5. ⏰ You're on a 5-day timeline - Day 1-2 is DONE

**The function search paths and CourtListener optimization can wait until Week 1** - they're warnings, not errors.
