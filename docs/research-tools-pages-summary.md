## Sitemap Updates

### File Modified: `/app/sitemap.ts`

Added two new entries to the `getStaticPages()` function:

```typescript
{
  url: `${siteUrl}/legal-research-tools`,
  lastModified: new Date(),
  changeFrequency: 'weekly' as const,
  priority: 0.7,
},
{
  url: `${siteUrl}/judicial-analytics`,
  lastModified: new Date(),
  changeFrequency: 'weekly' as const,
  priority: 0.75,
}
```

**Priority Rationale:**

- `legal-research-tools` (0.7): Important entry point for discovering platform features
- `judicial-analytics` (0.75): Core value proposition, higher than judges directory (0.8) but critical for SEO

**Change Frequency:** Weekly to match platform data update schedule
