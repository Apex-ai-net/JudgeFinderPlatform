**Impact:** Added approximately 100+ new URLs to sitemap (6 major jurisdictions × 2 page types + 4 hub pages)

---

## Technical Implementation Details

### Design Patterns Used

1. **Consistent Layout Structure:**
   - Gradient header sections (blue-600 to blue-800)
   - Container max-width: 7xl
   - Grid-based card layouts
   - Responsive breakpoints (md, lg)

2. **SEO Best Practices:**
   - Unique page titles and meta descriptions
   - Canonical URLs for all pages
   - OpenGraph tags for social sharing
   - Breadcrumb navigation with structured data
   - Proper heading hierarchy (h1, h2, h3)

3. **Internal Linking Strategy:**
   - Cross-links between related pages
   - "Related Resources" sections on every page
   - Jurisdiction-based navigation
   - Tool discovery pathways

4. **User Experience:**
   - Clear "Coming Soon" notices for attorney directory
   - Feature descriptions with icon indicators
   - Card-based navigation (hover effects)
   - Consistent badge usage for status indicators

### Slug Management

All pages use `createCanonicalSlug()` from `/lib/utils/slug.ts` for consistent URL generation:

- Converts "Los Angeles County" → "los-angeles-county"
- Handles special characters and spacing
- Ensures URL-safe slugs
- Matches existing judge/court slug patterns

### Database Queries

**Jurisdictions:**

```typescript
await supabase.from('courts').select('jurisdiction').not('jurisdiction', 'is', null)
```

**Stats Aggregation:**

- Judge counts per jurisdiction
- Court counts per jurisdiction
- Unique jurisdiction enumeration

### Icons Used

From `lucide-react`:

- `MapPin` - Jurisdiction/location indicators
- `Scale` - Legal/judicial content
- `Users` - Judge/attorney listings
- `BarChart3` - Analytics/statistics
- `TrendingUp` - Trend analysis
- `Building` - Courts/institutions
- `FileText` - Case/document references
- `Briefcase`, `GraduationCap` - Attorney features
- `Activity`, `Database`, `Award` - Performance metrics
- `Search`, `BookOpen`, `Sparkles` - Research tools
