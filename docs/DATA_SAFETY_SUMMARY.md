# Data Safety Measures - Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the comprehensive data validation and migration safety system implemented for the JudgeFinder platform. All deliverables have been completed and tested to ensure production readiness.

## Deliverables Completed

### 1. Pre-Launch Data Validation Script ✅

**File:** `scripts/validate-production-data.ts`

**Purpose:** Comprehensive validation before production deployment

**Features:**
- Validates judges have names (zero tolerance)
- Detects orphaned cases (judge_id references non-existent judge)
- Identifies duplicate CourtListener IDs
- Verifies case count accuracy (stored vs. actual)
- Ensures judges with 500+ cases have analytics
- Checks required fields (slugs, CourtListener IDs)
- Validates data integrity and relationships

**Usage:**
```bash
npm run validate-production-data

# Exit codes:
# 0 = All validations passed - Safe to deploy
# 1 = Critical issues found - Deployment blocked
# 2 = Warnings found - Review recommended
```

**Output:**
- JSON report: `validation-report.json`
- Console summary with color-coded status
- Specific fix commands for each issue
- Sample validation report: `docs/SAMPLE_VALIDATION_REPORT.md`

---

### 2. Automated Data Cleanup Script ✅

**File:** `scripts/cleanup-production-data.ts`

**Purpose:** Safe automated cleanup of data integrity issues

**Features:**
- Cleans up orphaned cases (nullify invalid judge_id)
- Removes orphaned court assignments
- Recalculates judge case counts
- Fixes duplicate CourtListener IDs (soft delete)
- Fixes inconsistent relationships
- All actions logged to audit trail

**Usage:**
```bash
# Dry run (preview changes)
npm run cleanup-production-data -- --dry-run

# Live cleanup (requires --force flag)
npm run cleanup-production-data -- --force
```

**Safety Features:**
- Dry run mode by default
- Requires explicit --force flag for modifications
- Transaction-based operations
- Soft delete instead of hard delete
- Complete audit trail in `cleanup-audit.json`
- Idempotent (safe to run multiple times)

**Audit Trail Example:**
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-01-08T10:30:00.000Z",
  "actions": [
    {
      "action": "CLEANUP_ORPHANED_CASES",
      "entity": "cases",
      "count": 15,
      "success": true
    }
  ],
  "totalRecordsAffected": 42,
  "success": true
}
```

---

### 3. Database Backup Script ✅

**File:** `scripts/backup-database.sh`

**Purpose:** Create complete database backups with compression

**Features:**
- Full database backup (schema + data)
- Schema-only backup option
- Data-only backup option
- Automatic compression (tar.gz)
- Backup metadata generation
- Automatic cleanup (keeps last 10 backups)
- Restoration instructions included

**Usage:**
```bash
# Full backup
npm run backup-database

# Schema only
bash scripts/backup-database.sh --schema-only

# Data only
bash scripts/backup-database.sh --data-only
```

**Backup Structure:**
```
backups/
├── judgefinder_backup_20250108_103045.tar.gz (compressed)
├── judgefinder_backup_20250108_103045_metadata.json (metadata)
└── [9 more historical backups]
```

**Metadata Example:**
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-01-08T10:30:45Z",
  "backup_name": "judgefinder_backup_20250108_103045",
  "backup_type": "full",
  "size_bytes": 15728640,
  "operator": "system"
}
```

**Restoration:**
```bash
# Extract backup
tar -xzf backups/judgefinder_backup_20250108_103045.tar.gz

# Restore to database
psql $SUPABASE_DB_URL < judgefinder_backup_20250108_103045_full.sql
```

### 4. Migration Safety Testing Script ✅

**File:** `scripts/test-migration.ts`

**Purpose:** Test database migrations in staging before production

**Features:**
- Connects to staging/development database
- Takes database snapshot before migration
- Applies pending migrations
- Validates foreign key constraints
- Checks for data loss
- Tests query performance
- Validates schema integrity
- Automatic rollback on failure

**Usage:**
```bash
# Test in staging
npm run test-migration

# Test with custom database
npm run test-migration -- --url=$STAGING_DB_URL --key=$STAGING_KEY

# Exit codes:
# 0 = Migration test passed - Safe to deploy
# 1 = Migration test failed - Rollback performed
```

**Test Flow:**
1. Take snapshot (record counts)
2. Identify pending migrations
3. Apply migrations sequentially
4. Validate constraints
5. Check for data loss
6. Test critical queries
7. Verify schema integrity
8. Rollback if any failures

**Output:**
- JSON report: `migration-test-report.json`
- Database snapshot: `migration-snapshot.json`
- Detailed test results with duration

---

### 5. Data Integrity Monitoring System ✅

**File:** `lib/monitoring/data-integrity.ts`

**Purpose:** Scheduled integrity checks with anomaly detection

**Features:**
- Orphaned record detection
- Case count drift monitoring (> 5% threshold)
- Missing required fields tracking
- Relationship consistency validation
- Stale data detection (180+ days)
- Health score calculation (0-100)
- Alert notifications (Slack, email)
- History tracking in database

**Usage:**
```typescript
import { DataIntegrityMonitor, sendIntegrityAlert } from '@/lib/monitoring/data-integrity'

const monitor = new DataIntegrityMonitor(supabaseUrl, supabaseKey)
const result = await monitor.runIntegrityCheck()

if (result.requires_action) {
  await sendIntegrityAlert(result)
}

await monitor.saveCheckResult(result)
```

**Anomaly Detection:**
- **Critical:** Missing judge names, severe orphaned records
- **High:** Orphaned cases > 10, assignments > 5, case count drift
- **Medium:** Missing slugs > 10, stale data, relationship inconsistencies
- **Low:** Minor data quality issues

**Health Score Calculation:**
- Critical issues: -20 points each
- High issues: -10 points each
- Medium issues: -5 points each
- Low issues: -2 points each
- Base score: 100

**Alert Example:**
```
🚨 Data Integrity Alert - JudgeFinder Platform

Health Score: 75/100
Checks Performed: 5
Anomalies Detected: 3

Critical Issues (0):

High Priority Issues (1):
• 15 judges have case count drift > 5%

Action Required: Review and run cleanup script
Command: npm run cleanup-production-data
```

---

### 6. Cron Endpoint for Analytics Views ✅

**Purpose:** Refresh materialized views for analytics performance

**Features:**
- Refreshes `decision_counts_by_judge_year` view
- Refreshes `top_judges_by_jurisdiction` view
- Concurrent refresh (non-blocking)
- Performance metrics logging
- Error handling and retry logic
- Security via cron secret

**Schedule:** Daily at 2 AM UTC (configured in netlify.toml or vercel.json)

package = "@netlify/plugin-nextjs"

[[edge_functions]]
function = "refresh-analytics-views"
path = "/api/cron/refresh-analytics-views"

[build.environment]
CRON_SCHEDULE = "0 2 * * *"
```

**Usage:**
```bash
# Manual trigger via API
curl -X POST https://judgefinder.io/api/cron/refresh-analytics-views \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $CRON_SECRET"
```

**Response Example:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
