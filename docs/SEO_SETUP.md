## Troubleshooting

### Google Search Console Verification Failed

**Problem:** "Verification failed" error

**Solutions:**

1. **Check environment variable:**

   ```bash
   # In browser console on your site:
   document.querySelector('meta[name="google-site-verification"]')?.content
   # Should return your verification code
   ```

2. **Verify deployment:** Ensure Netlify deployed with new environment variable
3. **Clear cache:** Netlify → Deploys → Trigger deploy → Clear cache and deploy
4. **Wait longer:** Verification can take up to 5 minutes
5. **Check HTML source:** View page source and search for `google-site-verification`

### Bing Verification Failed

**Problem:** "Could not verify" error

**Solutions:**

1. Same troubleshooting steps as Google verification
2. Check for `msvalidate.01` meta tag in HTML source
3. Try alternative verification method (XML file upload)

### Google Analytics Not Tracking

**Problem:** No data appearing in GA4 Realtime report

**Solutions:**

1. **Check Measurement ID:**

   ```bash
   # In browser console:
   console.log(window.gtag)
   # Should show function, not undefined
   ```

2. **Check for errors:** Browser DevTools → Console → Look for GA errors
3. **Verify script loading:** Network tab → Filter for `googletagmanager`
4. **Ad blocker:** Disable ad blockers and test
5. **Incognito mode:** Test in private/incognito window
6. **Environment variable:** Verify `NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_MEASUREMENT_ID` is set

### Sitemap Not Indexed

**Problem:** Sitemap submitted but URLs not indexed

**Solutions:**

1. **Check sitemap errors:** Search Console → Sitemaps → Error details
2. **Verify format:** Ensure sitemap is valid XML
3. **Check URL accessibility:** Each URL in sitemap should return HTTP 200
4. **Review robots.txt:** Ensure no rules blocking search engines
5. **Be patient:** Indexing can take days or weeks for new sites
6. **Request indexing:** Use URL Inspection tool to request indexing for key pages

### Structured Data Issues

**Problem:** "Invalid structured data" errors in Search Console

**Solutions:**

1. **Test with Rich Results Tool:** [Google Rich Results Test](https://search.google.com/test/rich-results)
2. **Check JSON-LD syntax:** Validate JSON in structured data script tags
3. **Review schema types:** Ensure using valid schema.org types
4. **Fix required properties:** Add any missing required schema properties

### No Organic Traffic

**Problem:** Site verified but no organic search traffic

**Solutions:**

1. **New site patience:** Takes 3-6 months for meaningful organic traffic
2. **Check indexing:** Ensure pages are actually indexed (search `site:judgefinder.io`)
3. **Review content quality:** Ensure pages have substantial, unique content
4. **Build backlinks:** Focus on getting quality backlinks
5. **Target long-tail keywords:** Optimize for less competitive search terms
