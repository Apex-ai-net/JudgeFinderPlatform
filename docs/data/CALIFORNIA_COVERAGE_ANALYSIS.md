## Data Quality Issues

### 1. Unmapped Judges (327 total)

327 judges could not be mapped to a specific county. These include:

**Federal Judges:**
- Court of Appeals (Circuit Courts)
- District Courts (E.D., C.D., N.D., S.D. California)
- Bankruptcy Courts
- Federal Magistrate Judges

**State-Level Judges:**
- California Supreme Court
- California Courts of Appeal
- Workers' Compensation Appeals Board (WCAB)
- State-wide administrative positions

**Sample Unmapped:**
- Franklin Stuart Van Antwerpen - Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit
- Lora J. Livingston - California State Courts (General)
- Victor A. Rodríguez - California Court of Appeal, 1st District
- W Richard Lee - United States Bankruptcy Court, E.D. California
- Jennifer L. Thurston - District Court, E.D. California
- Tani Gorre Cantil-Sakauye - California Supreme Court

**Why This Matters:**
- These judges serve multiple counties or the entire state
- County-based filtering may exclude them from searches
- May need special handling for state-wide/federal searches

### 2. Amador County Anomaly

**Issue:** Amador County shows 264 judges (26.4% of all CA judges)

**Likely Causes:**
1. Data import error or duplicate entries
2. Test data concentrated in one county
3. Default county assignment for unmapped judges

**Investigation Needed:**
- Review sample Amador County judges
- Check for duplicates
- Verify court assignments are legitimate

### 3. Missing Court Records

31 counties have judges but no court records. Priority for court data import:

**High Priority (Population + Judge Count):**
1. Contra Costa (19 judges)
2. Riverside (16 judges)
3. Ventura (10 judges)
4. Stanislaus (10 judges)
5. Santa Barbara (11 judges)
6. San Mateo (5 judges)

## Technical Details

### Query Used for Analysis

```typescript
// Fetch California judges
const caJudges = allJudges?.filter(j =>
  j.jurisdiction === 'CA' ||
  (j.jurisdiction && j.jurisdiction.toLowerCase().includes('california')) ||
  (j.court_name && j.court_name.toLowerCase().includes('california'))
) || [];

// Extract county from court names
function extractCounty(text: string | null): string | null {
  const patterns = [
    /County of ([A-Za-z\s]+)/i,
    /([A-Za-z\s]+) County/i,
    /([A-Za-z\s]+) Superior Court/i
  ];

  for (const pattern of patterns) {
    const match = text.match(pattern);
    if (match && match[1]) {
      const county = match[1].trim();
      if (ALL_CA_COUNTIES.includes(county)) {
        return county;
      }
    }
  }
  return null;
}
```

### Key Achievements

- 1,000 California judges with full CourtListener integration
- All 58 counties have at least some judge data
- 100% CourtListener ID coverage enables automated updates

### Areas for Improvement

1. **Resolve Amador County anomaly** (264 judges seems incorrect)
2. **Add court records** for 31 counties currently lacking them
3. **Improve coverage** for 22 counties with fewer than 5 judges
4. **Handle federal/state judges** that serve multiple counties

### Next Steps

Execute the recommendations in priority order, starting with investigating the Amador County data quality issue and adding missing court records for high-population counties.
