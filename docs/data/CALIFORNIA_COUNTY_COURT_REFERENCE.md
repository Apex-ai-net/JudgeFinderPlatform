## Pattern Matching Rules

The migration uses the following pattern matching logic to assign counties:

### Superior Courts
- Court name contains county name + "Superior"
- Address contains county name + "County"
- Address contains major city in the county

### Courts of Appeal
- Name contains "First/1st Appellate District" â†’ San Francisco
- Name contains "Second/2nd Appellate District" â†’ Los Angeles
- Name contains "Third/3rd Appellate District" â†’ Sacramento
- Name contains "Fourth/4th...Division One/1" â†’ San Diego
- Name contains "Fourth/4th...Division Two/2" â†’ Riverside
- Name contains "Fourth/4th...Division Three/3" â†’ Orange
- Name contains "Fifth/5th Appellate District" â†’ Fresno
- Name contains "Sixth/6th Appellate District" â†’ Santa Clara

### Supreme Court
- Name contains "California Supreme Court" â†’ San Francisco

### Federal Courts
- Name contains "Northern District of California" â†’ San Francisco
- Name contains "Eastern District of California" â†’ Sacramento
- Name contains "Central District of California" â†’ Los Angeles
- Name contains "Southern District of California" â†’ San Diego
- Name contains "Ninth Circuit" â†’ San Francisco

## Validation Queries

Use these queries to validate county mappings:

### Check all counties have courts
```sql
SELECT county, COUNT(*) as court_count
FROM courts
WHERE jurisdiction = 'CA' OR name ILIKE '%California%'
GROUP BY county
ORDER BY county;
```

### View the verification summary
```sql
SELECT * FROM california_courts_county_coverage
ORDER BY county;
```

### Find California courts without county assignments
```sql
SELECT id, name, jurisdiction, address
FROM courts
WHERE county IS NULL
  AND (jurisdiction = 'CA' OR name ILIKE '%California%' OR address ILIKE '%, CA%')
ORDER BY name;
```

### Count courts by county
```sql
SELECT county, COUNT(*) as total
FROM courts
WHERE county IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY county
ORDER BY total DESC;
```

---

## Special Cases and Notes

### Multi-County Courts
Some courts serve multiple counties but are assigned to their primary location:
- **9th Circuit Court of Appeals:** Assigned to San Francisco (headquarters) but serves all of California and other western states
- **Federal District Courts:** Assigned to their main courthouse location but serve multiple counties

### City/County Consolidation
- **San Francisco:** The only city-county in California, so "San Francisco" refers to both

### Common City Names
Watch for cities that exist in multiple counties:
- **Santa Clara:** Both a city (in Santa Clara County) and a county name
- **Orange:** Both a city (in Orange County) and a county name
- **Sacramento:** Both a city (in Sacramento County) and a county name

### CourtListener ID Mapping
The `courtlistener_id` field should be used as the primary key when syncing data from the CourtListener API to ensure accurate court identification.

---

## Maintenance

### When to Update This Mapping

This county mapping should be reviewed and updated when:
1. New courts are added to the database
2. Court jurisdictions change
3. Courts are renamed or reorganized
4. Federal district court divisions are modified
5. CourtListener API data structure changes

### Migration Dependencies

This migration depends on:
- `00000000000000_base_schema_idempotent.sql` (creates courts table)
- `20251108_001_add_county_to_courts.sql` (adds county column)

Future migrations that modify court structure should preserve the county mapping logic.
