## Quick Commands

### Check Current Status
```bash
# Get detailed analysis
npx tsx scripts/analyze-judge-completeness.ts

# Check sync progress
psql $DATABASE_URL -c "SELECT * FROM sync_progress_summary;"

# Quick judge count
psql $DATABASE_URL -c "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM judges;"
```

### Sync Education Data (Priority 1)
```bash
# Test with 10 judges first
npx tsx scripts/sync-education-data.ts -- --limit=10

# Full sync (1,649 judges, ~70 minutes)
npx tsx scripts/sync-education-data.ts
```

## Data Completeness Checklist

### ✅ Complete (100%)
- [x] CourtListener IDs (1,903/1,903)
- [x] Court Assignments (1,903/1,903)
- [x] Judge Coverage (103% of expected)

### ⚠️ Needs Attention
- [ ] Education Data (254/1,903 = 13.3%)
- [ ] Political Affiliation (unknown - check needed)
- [ ] Position History (unknown - check needed)
- [ ] Case Counts (unknown - check needed)

### ❓ Unknown - Run Analysis
- [ ] How many judges have `total_cases > 0`?
- [ ] How many judges have `total_cases >= 500`? (analytics-ready)
- [ ] Is `sync_progress` table populated?
- [ ] Federal judge count in database?

### Judges Table Fields
```sql
courtlistener_id       VARCHAR(50)   -- ✅ 100% populated
education              TEXT          -- ⚠️ 13.3% populated
political_affiliation  VARCHAR(100)  -- ❓ unknown
positions              JSONB         -- ❓ unknown

```

### Sync Progress Table
```sql
sync_progress (
  judge_id UUID,
  has_education BOOLEAN,
  has_political_affiliations BOOLEAN,
  has_positions BOOLEAN,
  total_cases_count INTEGER,
  is_complete BOOLEAN,
  is_analytics_ready BOOLEAN,  -- TRUE if 500+ cases
