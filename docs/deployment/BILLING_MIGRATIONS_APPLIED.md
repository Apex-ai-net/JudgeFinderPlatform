---

## Migrations Applied

### 1. Migration: 20251013_001_ad_orders_table.sql ✅

**Purpose**: Create ad_orders table with Stripe integration
**Location**: `/Users/tannerosterkamp/JudgeFinder/JudgeFinderPlatform/supabase/migrations/20251013_001_ad_orders_table.sql`

**Changes Made**:
- Created `ad_orders` table to track completed ad space purchases
- Added Stripe integration fields (session_id, payment_intent, customer)
- Implemented order status tracking (pending, paid, fulfilled, refunded, canceled)
- Created performance indexes:
  - `idx_ad_orders_stripe_session` - Fast lookup by Stripe session ID
  - `idx_ad_orders_email` - Customer email queries
  - `idx_ad_orders_status` - Filter by order status
  - `idx_ad_orders_created_at` - Chronological sorting
  - `idx_ad_orders_ad_type` - Filter by ad type
- Enabled Row Level Security (RLS)
- Added trigger for automatic `updated_at` timestamp

**Security**:
- Service role has full access (for webhook handlers)
- Authenticated users can view their own orders by email
- Admin users can view all orders

### 2. Migration: 20251015_002_auth_gated_ad_orders.sql ✅

**Purpose**: Add Clerk user ID extraction and RLS policies
**Location**: `/Users/tannerosterkamp/JudgeFinder/JudgeFinderPlatform/supabase/migrations/20251015_002_auth_gated_ad_orders.sql`

**Changes Made**:
- Created `requesting_user_id()` function to extract Clerk user ID from JWT
  - Reads the 'sub' claim from JWT token
  - Format: `user_2abc123...`
  - Used by RLS policies for access control
- Updated RLS policies for Clerk-based authentication:
  - Users can view their own orders via Clerk ID
  - Users can insert their own orders
  - Users can update their own orders
  - Service role maintains full access

**Security Enhancement**:
- Replaced email-based access control with Clerk user ID
- More secure and direct user identification
- Prevents email spoofing attacks

### 3. Migration: 20250119000000_judge_ad_products_and_bookings.sql ✅

**Purpose**: Create judge ad products, bookings, and checkout tables
**Location**: `/Users/tannerosterkamp/JudgeFinder/JudgeFinderPlatform/supabase/migrations/20250119000000_judge_ad_products_and_bookings.sql`

**Changes Made**:

#### Table: `judge_ad_products`
- Caches Stripe product and price IDs for each judge's ad spots
- Prevents recreating products in Stripe
- Fields:
  - `judge_id` (FK to judges table)
  - `position` (1 or 2 for rotation slots)
  - `stripe_product_id`
  - `stripe_monthly_price_id`
  - `stripe_annual_price_id`
  - `court_level` (federal $500/mo, state $200/mo)
- Unique constraint: One product per judge per position
- Indexes for fast lookups

#### Table: `ad_spot_bookings`
- Tracks active and historical ad spot bookings with Stripe subscriptions
- Fields:
  - `judge_id`, `advertiser_id`
  - `stripe_subscription_id`, `stripe_product_id`, `stripe_customer_id`
  - `position` (1 or 2)
  - `billing_interval` (monthly, annual)
  - `status` (active, past_due, canceled, paused, incomplete, trialing)
  - Billing period tracking
- **Double-booking prevention**: Unique partial index on (judge_id, position) for active bookings
- RLS policies:
  - Advertisers can view/update their own bookings
  - Public can view active bookings (for displaying ads)

#### Table: `checkout_sessions`
- Temporary storage for linking checkout sessions to subscriptions
- Auto-expires after 24 hours
- Used during webhook processing to connect Stripe events

**Security**:
- Full RLS enabled on all tables
- Service role access for webhook handlers
- User-scoped access for advertisers
- Public read access only for active bookings

| `ad_spot_bookings`  | ✅     | 0 rows    | Active ad bookings with subscriptions    |
| `checkout_sessions` | ✅     | 0 rows    | Temporary checkout session storage       |

### Functions Created ✅

| Function Name          | Status | Description                              |
|-----------------------|--------|------------------------------------------|
| `requesting_user_id()` | ✅     | Extracts Clerk user ID from JWT sub claim |
| `update_ad_orders_updated_at()` | ✅ | Auto-updates updated_at timestamp  |
| `update_updated_at_column()` | ✅ | Generic updated_at trigger function |

### Security Features ✅

- ✅ Row Level Security (RLS) enabled on all billing tables
- ✅ Clerk user ID extraction function operational
- ✅ Service role bypass for webhook handlers
- ✅ User-scoped read/write policies
- ✅ Admin access policies
- ✅ Public read access for active ads only

- ✅ Indexes on `stripe_session_id`, `customer_email`, `status`
- ✅ Indexes on `judge_id`, `advertiser_id` for fast lookups
- ✅ Partial indexes for active bookings only
- ✅ Unique indexes for data integrity

### Business Logic ✅

- ✅ Double-booking prevention via unique partial index
- ✅ Automatic timestamp updates via triggers
- ✅ Cascading deletes on judge/advertiser removal
- ✅ Status validation via CHECK constraints
- ✅ Court level pricing differentiation (federal vs state)

## Database Schema Overview

### Ad Orders Flow
```
Checkout → checkout_sessions (temp) → Stripe Webhook → ad_orders (permanent)
```

### Judge Ad Booking Flow
```
1. Create/Get judge_ad_products (cache Stripe product IDs)
2. Create Stripe checkout session
3. User completes payment
4. Webhook creates ad_spot_bookings record
5. Subscription remains active (recurring billing)
```

---

## Integration Points

### Stripe Integration ✅
- **Webhook Endpoint**: `/api/stripe/webhook`
- **Events Handled**:
  - `checkout.session.completed` → Creates ad_orders record
  - `customer.subscription.created` → Creates ad_spot_bookings
  - `customer.subscription.updated` → Updates booking status
  - `customer.subscription.deleted` → Marks booking as canceled

### Clerk Integration ✅
- **Function**: `requesting_user_id()`
- **JWT Claim**: `sub` (Clerk user ID)
- **Usage**: RLS policies for user-scoped access

### Application Routes ✅
- **Purchase Flow**: `/ads/buy` → `/api/checkout/adspace` → Stripe
- **Judge-Specific**: `/ads/checkout/judge/[id]` → Creates subscription
- **Order Management**: Protected by RLS, users see only their orders

## Testing Recommendations

### Manual Testing Checklist
- [ ] Test ad purchase flow as authenticated user
- [ ] Verify Stripe webhook receives events
- [ ] Check ad_orders table populates after purchase
- [ ] Test double-booking prevention (attempt duplicate booking)
- [ ] Verify RLS policies (users can't see others' orders)
- [ ] Test subscription cancellation flow
- [ ] Verify checkout_sessions cleanup (24hr expiry)

### Automated Testing
- [ ] E2E test: `/tests/e2e/ad-purchase.spec.ts`
- [ ] Unit tests for webhook handlers
- [ ] RLS policy tests

---

## Configuration Required

### Environment Variables (Already Set in Netlify)
- ✅ `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` - Production Stripe key
- ✅ `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` - Webhook signing secret
- ✅ `NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` - Client-side key
- ✅ `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` - Database access
- ✅ `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` - Supabase project URL

### Stripe Configuration
- ✅ Webhook endpoint configured
- ✅ Products created for judge ads
- ✅ Price IDs stored in database
- ⚠️  **Action Required**: Verify webhook URL in Stripe Dashboard points to production

---

## Rollback Plan

In case of issues, migrations can be rolled back by:

1. **Drop tables** (in reverse order):
   ```sql
   DROP TABLE IF EXISTS checkout_sessions CASCADE;
   DROP TABLE IF EXISTS ad_spot_bookings CASCADE;
   DROP TABLE IF EXISTS judge_ad_products CASCADE;
   DROP TABLE IF EXISTS ad_orders CASCADE;
   ```

2. **Drop functions**:
   ```sql
   DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS requesting_user_id();
   DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS update_ad_orders_updated_at();
   DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS update_updated_at_column();
   ```

**Note**: Rollback should only be performed if critical issues arise. All migrations are idempotent and can be safely re-applied.

---

## Monitoring

### Key Metrics to Monitor
- Ad order creation rate
- Failed webhook events
- Double-booking attempts (should be 0)
- Subscription status distribution
- Average time to fulfill orders

### Database Queries
```sql
-- Check recent ad orders
SELECT * FROM ad_orders
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- Check active bookings
SELECT * FROM ad_spot_bookings
WHERE status IN ('active', 'trialing')
ORDER BY created_at DESC;

-- Check expired sessions (cleanup needed)
SELECT * FROM checkout_sessions
WHERE expires_at < NOW();
```

---

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy Application**: Ensure latest code is deployed to Netlify
2. **Test Webhooks**: Send test events from Stripe Dashboard
3. **Monitor Logs**: Watch for any errors in webhook processing
4. **User Acceptance Testing**: Have test users complete purchases
5. **Documentation**: Update API documentation for ad purchase endpoints

---

## Support & Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue**: Webhook not receiving events
**Solution**: Verify webhook URL in Stripe Dashboard, check signing secret

**Issue**: RLS policy denying access
**Solution**: Verify user is authenticated and Clerk JWT contains `sub` claim

**Issue**: Double-booking not prevented
**Solution**: Check unique index exists: `idx_ad_bookings_unique_active`

**Issue**: Orders not appearing for user
**Solution**: Verify `created_by` field matches Clerk user ID
