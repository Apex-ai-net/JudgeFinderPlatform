## ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Action Items

### Must Do Before Production Launch

1. **Configure Production Stripe Keys**
   - Current: Test mode keys (sk_test_*)
   - Needed: Live mode keys (sk_live_*)
   - Impact: Without this, real payments won't process
   - Time: 30 minutes

2. **Set Up Webhook Endpoint**
   - Current: Not configured
   - Needed: Webhook at https://judgefinder.io/api/stripe/webhook
   - Impact: Payments succeed but orders not recorded
   - Time: 20 minutes

3. **Apply Database Migrations**
   - Current: Migrations exist but not applied
   - Needed: Run migrations on production Supabase
   - Impact: Database errors, no data persistence
   - Time: 30 minutes

4. **Update Price IDs**
   - Current: Placeholder values
   - Needed: Real price IDs from Stripe Dashboard
   - Impact: Checkout creation fails
   - Time: 15 minutes

### Should Do (Recommended)

5. **Configure SendGrid for Emails**
   - Current: Not configured
   - Impact: No receipt or dunning emails sent
   - Time: 30 minutes
   - Priority: Medium (nice to have)

6. **Set Up Monitoring Alerts**
   - Current: Manual monitoring only
   - Needed: Automated alerts for failures
   - Time: 1 hour
   - Priority: Medium

### Can Do Later (Optional)

7. **Create Organization Billing Products**
   - Only needed if offering SaaS plans
   - Time: 1 hour

8. **Build Admin Dashboard**
   - For managing subscriptions/refunds
   - Time: 1-2 weeks
