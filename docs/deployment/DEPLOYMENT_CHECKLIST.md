## Database Migrations

### Migration Order

Apply these migrations in the following order:

1. **Service Account RBAC** (if not already applied)

   ```sql
   supabase/migrations/20251009_001_service_account_rbac.sql
   ```

2. **Performance Indexes** (NEW - from optimization agent)

   ```sql
   supabase/migrations/20251008_003_performance_indexes.sql
   ```

3. **Onboarding Analytics** (FIXED - from analytics agent)
   ```sql
   supabase/migrations/20251008_002_onboarding_analytics_FIXED.sql
   ```

### Migration Application Steps

```bash
# 1. Backup database first
npm run backup-database

# 2. Test migrations on staging/local first
npx supabase db reset --local

# 3. Apply to production via Supabase Dashboard
# Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/[PROJECT-ID]/sql/new
# Copy and paste each migration file content
# Execute one at a time, verify success before proceeding
```

## Environment Variables

### Required (Already Set)

- `GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY` - Gemini AI for search intelligence
- `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL` - Redis caching
- `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN` - Redis auth
- `SUPABASE_URL` - Database connection
- `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` - Public Supabase key

### Optional Additions (For New Features)

- `SUPABASE_JWT_SECRET` - For service account authentication
- `SERVICE_ACCOUNT_ENCRYPTION_KEY` - For sensitive data encryption

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Pre-Deployment

```bash
# Verify environment
npm run validate:env

# Run full test suite
npm run test:ci

# Build production bundle
npm run build:production
```

### 2. Database Backup

```bash
# Create backup before any changes
npm run backup-database

# Verify backup was created
ls -lah backups/
```

### 3. Apply Migrations

- [ ] Access Supabase Dashboard SQL Editor
- [ ] Apply migration `20251008_003_performance_indexes.sql`
- [ ] Verify indexes created: Check query performance
- [ ] Apply migration `20251008_002_onboarding_analytics_FIXED.sql`
- [ ] Verify analytics functions work

### 4. Deploy Code

```bash
# If using Netlify
git push origin main

# If using Vercel
vercel --prod

# If manual deployment
npm run build && npm run start
```

### 5. Post-Deployment Verification

```bash
# Run verification script
npm run test:integration

# Check critical endpoints
curl https://judgefinder.io/api/health
curl https://judgefinder.io/api/judges?limit=1
curl https://judgefinder.io/api/search?q=test

# Verify database migrations
# Check Supabase Dashboard > Database > Migrations
```

### 6. Monitor

- [ ] Check error logs in Sentry
- [ ] Monitor response times in performance dashboard
- [ ] Verify Redis cache hit rates
- [ ] Check database query performance
- [ ] Monitor API rate limits

## Rollback Plan

### If Issues Occur

1. **Code Issues**

   ```bash
   # Revert to previous deployment
   git revert HEAD
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Database Issues**

   ```bash
   # Restore from backup
   # Via Supabase Dashboard: Database > Backups > Restore

   # Or manually
   psql $DATABASE_URL < backups/backup-TIMESTAMP.sql
   ```

3. **Performance Issues**
   - Disable new indexes if causing slow writes
   - Clear Redis cache: `redis-cli FLUSHALL`
   - Rollback to previous Git commit

## Health Checks

### Critical Paths to Test

- [ ] Homepage loads
- [ ] Judge search works
- [ ] Court listings display
- [ ] Analytics dashboards render
- [ ] Admin panel accessible
- [ ] API endpoints respond within 500ms
- [ ] Database queries optimized with new indexes

### Performance Benchmarks

- [ ] Homepage: < 2s load time
- [ ] Search results: < 500ms response
- [ ] Judge profile: < 1s load time
- [ ] API /judges: < 300ms response
- [ ] API /search: < 500ms response
- [ ] Cache hit rate: > 80%

## Post-Deployment Tasks

### Immediate (Within 1 Hour)

- [ ] Run post-deployment verification script
- [ ] Check error rates in monitoring
- [ ] Verify all critical features working
- [ ] Test on production with real searches

### Short-term (Within 24 Hours)

- [ ] Monitor query performance metrics
- [ ] Review cache effectiveness
- [ ] Check for any user-reported issues
- [ ] Analyze performance improvements from indexes

### Medium-term (Within 1 Week)

- [ ] Review analytics data quality
- [ ] Assess search quality improvements
- [ ] Monitor database size and growth
- [ ] Evaluate cache memory usage

## Emergency Contacts

- **Database Issues**: Check Supabase Status Page
- **Deployment Issues**: Netlify/Vercel Dashboard
- **Code Issues**: Revert via Git
- **Performance Issues**: Check Sentry and logs
