## What Was Configured

### 1. GitHub Actions Workflows

Five production-ready workflows created in `.github/workflows/`:

#### Production Deployment (`deploy-production.yml`)
- **Trigger**: Push to `main` branch
- **Duration**: ~25-35 minutes
- **Steps**:
  1. Pre-deployment validation (security scan, env check)
  2. Comprehensive test suite (unit, integration, E2E)
  3. Production build with security checks
  4. Deploy to Netlify
  5. Post-deployment verification
  6. Health checks and API testing

**Features**:
- Automated security scanning
- Parallel test execution
- Build artifact optimization
- Post-build security verification
- Automatic commit comments with deploy URL
- Comprehensive error reporting

#### Preview Deployment (`preview-deployment.yml`)
- **Trigger**: Pull requests to `main`
- **Duration**: ~15-20 minutes
- **Steps**:
  1. Quick validation (lint, type-check, security)
  2. Run test suite
  3. Build preview
  4. Deploy to Netlify preview URL
  5. Comment PR with preview link

**Features**:
- Per-PR preview URLs
- Automatic PR comments
- Quick feedback loop
- Full feature testing before merge

#### Rollback (`rollback.yml`)
- **Trigger**: Manual workflow dispatch
- **Duration**: ~5-10 minutes
- **Steps**:
  1. Display rollback information
  2. List recent deployments
  3. Execute rollback (to previous or specific deploy)
  4. Verify rollback success
  5. Health check

**Features**:
- Instant rollback capability
- Rollback to any previous deployment
- Requires reason (for audit trail)
- Automatic verification

#### Security Audit (`security-audit.yml`)
- **Trigger**: Weekly (Mondays 9 AM UTC) + manual + package.json changes
- **Duration**: ~10-15 minutes
- **Steps**:
  1. npm audit for vulnerable dependencies
  2. Secret scanning (exposed keys/tokens)
  3. Code quality checks (lint, type-check)
  4. Environment configuration validation
  5. netlify.toml validation

**Features**:
- Fails on critical vulnerabilities
- Detects exposed secrets
- Validates configuration files
- Generates audit reports

#### Existing Workflows (Enhanced)
- **Test Suite** (`test.yml`): Comprehensive testing
- **Accessibility** (`accessibility.yml`): WCAG compliance checks

### 2. Enhanced Netlify Configuration

#### Updated `netlify.toml`

**New Features**:
- Smart build ignoring (skip builds for docs-only changes)
- Increased Node memory (4GB for large builds)
- Production context optimizations
- Staging environment configuration
- Split testing support (A/B testing)
- Enhanced security settings

**Key Sections**:

```toml
[build]
  command = "npm run build"
  ignore = "git diff --quiet ... ':(exclude)docs/' ':(exclude)*.md'"

[build.environment]
  NODE_VERSION = "20"
  NODE_OPTIONS = "--max-old-space-size=4096"
  NPM_FLAGS = "--legacy-peer-deps"

[context.production]
  command = "npm run build:production"

[context.staging]
  command = "npm run build"
```

**Headers**: Already configured for security and caching
**Redirects**: SEO-friendly sitemap redirects
**Functions**: Configured for long-running sync operations

### 3. Comprehensive Documentation

#### Production Deployment Guide
**File**: `/docs/deployment/PRODUCTION_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md`

**Covers**:
- Complete deployment process
- Prerequisites and setup
- Environment variable configuration
- GitHub Actions setup
- Monitoring and verification
- Rollback procedures
- Troubleshooting guide
- 40+ pages of detailed instructions

#### Environment Setup Guide
**File**: `/docs/deployment/NETLIFY_ENVIRONMENT_SETUP.md`

## Next Steps (User Action Required)

### 1. Configure GitHub Secrets

**Navigate to**: Repository → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions

**Add these secrets**:

```bash
# Netlify
NETLIFY_SITE_ID=your_site_id_here
NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN=your_auth_token_here

# Build-time variables (subset)
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_live_your_key
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_your_key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key
SUPABASE_JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
```

**How to get Netlify credentials**:

```bash
# Site ID
# Netlify Dashboard → Site settings → Site details → API ID

# Auth Token
# User settings → Applications → Personal access tokens → New access token
# Scopes needed: Full access (or at minimum: Deploy hooks, Site builds)
```

### 2. Configure Netlify Environment Variables

**Navigate to**: Netlify Dashboard → Site settings → Environment variables

**Add all production variables** (see `/docs/deployment/NETLIFY_ENVIRONMENT_SETUP.md`)

**Quick checklist**:
- [ ] Clerk authentication (pk_live_, sk_live_)
- [ ] Supabase database
- [ ] Stripe payments
- [ ] SendGrid email
- [ ] Upstash Redis
- [ ] CourtListener API
- [ ] OpenAI or Google AI
- [ ] Cloudflare Turnstile
- [ ] Internal security keys
- [ ] Admin user IDs

### 3. Enable GitHub Actions

**Navigate to**: Repository → Settings → Actions → General

**Configure**:
- [ ] Enable "Allow all actions and reusable workflows"
- [ ] Set workflow permissions to "Read and write permissions"
- [ ] Enable "Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests"

### 4. Test Deployment Pipeline

**Option A: Deploy Preview (Recommended First)**

```bash
# 1. Create test branch
git checkout -b test/ci-cd-setup

# 2. Make minor change
echo "# CI/CD Test" >> docs/TEST.md
git add docs/TEST.md
git commit -m "test: verify CI/CD pipeline"

# 3. Push and create PR
git push origin test/ci-cd-setup
gh pr create --title "Test: CI/CD Pipeline" --body "Testing deployment preview"

# 4. Check GitHub Actions tab for running workflows
# 5. Wait for PR comment with preview URL
# 6. Verify preview deployment works
```

**Option B: Production Deploy (After Preview Success)**

```bash
# 1. Merge test PR
gh pr merge --squash

# 2. Monitor GitHub Actions → Production Deployment
# 3. Wait for completion (~25-35 minutes)
# 4. Verify at https://judgefinder.io
```

### 5. Verify Deployment

**Immediate checks** (run after deployment):

```bash
# Site is live
curl -I https://judgefinder.io

# Critical pages
curl -I https://judgefinder.io/judges
curl -I https://judgefinder.io/courts

# API health
curl https://judgefinder.io/api/health | jq

# Sitemap
curl -I https://judgefinder.io/sitemap.xml
```

**Functional tests**:
1. Visit https://judgefinder.io
2. Test search functionality
3. Try AI chat
4. Test authentication (sign in/out)
5. View judge profile with analytics

## Best Practices

### DO

✅ Always create PRs for changes (get preview deploys)
✅ Wait for all checks to pass before merging
✅ Review deploy preview before production merge
✅ Monitor deployment progress in GitHub Actions
✅ Verify site after deployment
✅ Use rollback if issues detected within 24 hours
✅ Keep environment variables in sync with docs
✅ Rotate secrets quarterly

### DON'T

❌ Push directly to main (bypasses preview)
❌ Merge PRs with failing tests
❌ Skip security checks (emergency skip only)
❌ Commit secrets to repository
❌ Use test API keys in production
❌ Deploy on Friday evenings (limited monitoring)
❌ Ignore failed health checks

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: GitHub Actions workflow not running

**Check**:
1. GitHub Actions enabled? (Settings → Actions)
2. Workflow file syntax correct? (YAML validator)
3. Branch protection rules blocking? (Settings → Branches)

### Issue: Netlify deployment fails

**Check**:
1. NETLIFY_SITE_ID correct? (compare with dashboard)
2. NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN valid? (regenerate if needed)
3. Build succeeds locally? (`npm run build`)
4. Environment variables set? (Netlify dashboard)

### Issue: Tests failing in CI but pass locally

**Common causes**:
1. Missing environment variables
2. Different Node version
3. Dependency version mismatch
4. Race conditions in tests

**Solution**:
```bash
# Match CI environment
nvm use 20
npm ci --legacy-peer-deps
npm test
```

### Issue: Deploy preview not commenting on PR

**Check**:
1. GitHub Actions permissions (Settings → Actions)
2. GITHUB_TOKEN has write access
3. Branch protection rules allow bot comments
