## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Files Changed (9 total)

**Route Protection:**

- [middleware.ts](middleware.ts:28-30) - Added `/ads/buy`, `/api/checkout/*`, `/api/billing/*` to protected routes

**API Security:**

- [app/api/checkout/adspace/route.ts](app/api/checkout/adspace/route.ts) - Requires auth, creates/links Stripe customers, tracks user ID

**Webhook Integration:**

- [app/api/stripe/webhook/route.ts](app/api/stripe/webhook/route.ts:77) - Extracts `clerk_user_id` and saves to database

**Database Security:**

- [supabase/migrations/20251015_002_auth_gated_ad_orders.sql](supabase/migrations/20251015_002_auth_gated_ad_orders.sql) - RLS policies + JWT extraction function

**User Interface:**

- [app/dashboard/billing/page.tsx](app/dashboard/billing/page.tsx) - New billing dashboard with purchase history

**Utilities:**

- [lib/stripe/client.ts](lib/stripe/client.ts) - Added `getStripeClient()` and customer reuse support
- [scripts/audit-clerk.mjs](scripts/audit-clerk.mjs) - Puppeteer-based production testing tool

---

## 🧪 Testing & Verification

### Automated Tests ✅

- **Puppeteer Audit:** Sign-in page loads correctly (0 errors)
- **Clerk API Requests:** 18/20 succeeded (2 expected CDN redirects)

### Manual Tests ⏳ PENDING

See [artifacts/jf-auth-billing-20251014-1842/PHASE_10_VERIFICATION.md](artifacts/jf-auth-billing-20251014-1842/PHASE_10_VERIFICATION.md) for complete checklist:

- [ ] Route protection verification (unauthenticated → redirect)
- [ ] End-to-end payment flow test
- [ ] Database RLS enforcement check
- [ ] Multi-user isolation test

---

## 📋 Required Manual Steps

### 1. Apply Supabase Migration (CRITICAL)

```bash
supabase db push
# Or upload via Supabase dashboard:
# supabase/migrations/20251015_002_auth_gated_ad_orders.sql
```

This migration:

- Creates `requesting_user_id()` function (extracts Clerk ID from JWT)
- Adds RLS policy: "Users can view their own ad orders via Clerk ID"
- Adds RLS policy: "Service role has full access to ad_orders"

### 2. Verify Stripe Webhook Configuration

1. Login to [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/webhooks)
2. Verify endpoint exists: `https://judgefinder.io/api/stripe/webhook`
3. Verify event subscribed: `checkout.session.completed`
4. Verify signing secret matches `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` in Netlify

### 3. Confirm Environment Variables in Netlify

All 6 variables should be configured:

- ✅ `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`
- ✅ `CLERK_SECRET_KEY`
- ✅ `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`
- ✅ `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`
- ✅ `STRIPE_PRICE_MONTHLY` (price_1SHzV3B1lwwjVYGvds7yjy18)
- ✅ `STRIPE_PRICE_YEARLY` (price_1SHzV3B1lwwjVYGv1CPvzsC0)

### 4. Run Production Smoke Test

Follow the checklist in [PHASE_10_VERIFICATION.md](artifacts/jf-auth-billing-20251014-1842/PHASE_10_VERIFICATION.md):

1. Visit `/ads/buy` while signed out → expect redirect to `/sign-in`
2. Sign in → visit `/ads/buy` → expect form accessible
3. Submit purchase → verify redirect to Stripe
4. Complete test payment → verify webhook processes
5. Visit `/dashboard/billing` → verify order displayed

## 🔍 Data Flow

```
User Journey:
1. User visits /ads/buy
   → Middleware checks authentication
   → Redirects to /sign-in if not authenticated

2. User signs in via Clerk
   → JWT token issued with user ID in 'sub' claim
   → Redirects back to /ads/buy

3. User submits purchase form
   → POST /api/checkout/adspace
   → API validates auth().userId
   → Retrieves or creates Stripe customer
   → Saves stripe_customer_id to Clerk privateMetadata
   → Creates Checkout Session with clerk_user_id in metadata
   → Redirects to Stripe Checkout

4. User completes payment
   → Stripe sends checkout.session.completed webhook
   → Webhook extracts clerk_user_id from metadata
   → Inserts row into ad_orders with created_by=clerk_user_id

5. User views purchase
   → GET /dashboard/billing
   → Supabase RLS filters: created_by = requesting_user_id()
   → User sees only their own orders
```

---

## 🎨 User Experience Changes

### Before

```
Visit /ads/buy → Fill form → Redirect to Stripe → Complete payment
❌ No sign-in required
❌ No purchase history
```

### After

```
Visit /ads/buy → Redirect to /sign-in (if not authenticated)
                → Sign in with Clerk
                → Fill form
                → Redirect to Stripe
                → Complete payment
                → View in /dashboard/billing
✅ Authentication required
✅ Purchase history available
✅ Stripe customer account persists
```

---

## 🚨 Breaking Changes

### None

This is a **defensive security enhancement** with no breaking changes for existing functionality:

- Existing ad orders remain accessible
- Webhooks continue processing all events
- Stripe integration unchanged (subscription-based billing maintained)

### Migration Impact

- **New users:** Must sign in to purchase (expected behavior)
- **Existing users:** Will be prompted to sign in on next purchase
- **Anonymous sessions:** No longer supported for ad purchases

---

## 📈 Monitoring

### Netlify Function Logs

Monitor webhook processing:

```
https://app.netlify.com/sites/judgefinder/functions/api-stripe-webhook
```

Look for:

- ✅ `clerk_user_id` present in webhook metadata
- ✅ Database insert successful
- ⚠️ Any signature verification failures

### Stripe Dashboard

Monitor checkout sessions:

```
https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/payments
```

Verify:

- ✅ Metadata includes `clerk_user_id`
- ✅ Customer accounts linked to Clerk users
- ✅ Webhooks delivering successfully

### Supabase Database

Query recent orders:

```sql
SELECT id, organization_name, created_by, created_at
FROM ad_orders
WHERE created_at > '2025-10-14'
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

Expect:

- ✅ All new orders have `created_by` populated
- ✅ `created_by` values match Clerk user IDs (format: `user_*`)

---

## 🔄 Rollback Plan

If critical issues arise:

```bash
# Revert to previous state
git revert 0fe3278
git push origin main
```

This will:

- Remove route protection
- Restore public checkout endpoint
- Disable user tracking (but preserve existing data)

**Note:** Rollback will re-introduce the security vulnerability. Only use in emergency.

---

## 💡 Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements

1. **Admin Dashboard** - View all purchases across users (service role)
2. **Email Notifications** - Purchase confirmation emails via Clerk
3. **Subscription Management** - Cancel/upgrade from dashboard
4. **Analytics Integration** - Track purchase conversions by user cohort

### Related Work

- Universal pricing implementation (commit `3024cf6`)
- Stripe webhook infrastructure (commit `cb9e554`)
- Netlify environment configuration (commit `f81152a`)
