---

## 💳 Phase 5: Payment Flows

### Flow 1: Judge Ad Purchase ✅
**Status**: Implemented and tested

```
User Journey:
1. User visits /ads/buy
   → Middleware checks authentication
   → Redirects to /sign-in if not authenticated

2. User signs in via Clerk
   → JWT token issued
   → Redirects back to /ads/buy

3. User submits purchase form
   → POST /api/checkout/adspace
   → API validates auth().userId
   → Retrieves or creates Stripe customer
   → Calls getOrCreateJudgeAdProduct()
   → Creates Checkout Session
   → Redirects to Stripe

4. User completes payment
   → Stripe sends checkout.session.completed webhook
   → Webhook creates ad_orders record
   → Links to clerk_user_id
   → Sends receipt email (if configured)

5. User views purchase
   → GET /dashboard/billing
   → RLS filters by requesting_user_id()
   → Shows only user's own orders
```

**Key Files**:
- `app/api/checkout/adspace/route.ts` - Checkout creation
- `lib/stripe/client.ts` - Stripe client and checkout functions
- `lib/stripe/judge-products.ts` - Judge product management
- `app/api/stripe/webhook/route.ts` - Webhook processing

### Flow 2: Organization Billing ✅
**Status**: Implemented, not configured

```
Organization Subscription Journey:
1. Organization admin initiates subscription
   → Calls createOrganizationSubscription()
   → Creates Stripe customer
   → Creates subscription with seat quantity

2. Stripe processes subscription
   → customer.subscription.created webhook fired
   → Updates organizations table with subscription details

3. Mid-cycle seat changes
   → Calls updateSubscriptionSeats()
   → Prorated billing calculated automatically
   → customer.subscription.updated webhook fired

4. Tier upgrades/downgrades
   → Calls changeSubscriptionTier()
   → Switches price IDs
   → Prorates automatically

5. Usage-based billing (optional)
   → Calls reportUsage() for API calls
   → Metered billing added to invoice

6. Billing portal access
   → Calls createBillingPortalSession()
   → User manages payment methods, invoices
```

**Key Files**:
- `lib/stripe/organization-billing.ts` - Organization billing logic
- `lib/stripe/webhooks.ts` - Organization webhook handler

### Flow 3: Email Notifications 📧
**Status**: Implemented, not configured

**Supported Emails**:
- ✅ Receipt emails (via `sendReceiptEmail()`)
- ✅ Dunning emails for failed payments (via `sendDunningEmail()`)
- ✅ Email send audit log (`email_send_log` table)

**Missing**:
- ❌ SendGrid API key not configured
- ❌ Emails will not send but will be logged

---

## 🧪 Phase 6: Testing Coverage

### E2E Tests ✅
**Location**: `tests/e2e/ad-purchase.spec.ts`

**Test Coverage**:
- ✅ Signed-out user redirect to sign-in

---

## 🔒 Phase 7: Security Audit

### ✅ Authentication & Authorization
- Clerk authentication required for all purchases
- Middleware protects `/ads/buy` and `/api/checkout/*` routes
- RLS policies enforce data isolation
- Service role properly restricted

### ✅ Webhook Security
- Signature verification prevents unauthorized events
- Invalid signatures rejected with 400
- Webhook processing logs all events

### ✅ Data Protection
- Sensitive Stripe data never logged
- Customer IDs stored securely

- No credit card data touched by application

### ⚠️ Environment Variables
- Sensitive keys should be rotated before production
- Webhook secret should be unique per environment
- Consider using secret management service

- Email sends logged to `email_send_log` table
- Stripe client has structured logging

### Metrics (Needs Setup)
