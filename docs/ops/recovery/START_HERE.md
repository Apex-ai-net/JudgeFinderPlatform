## 🆘 If You Get Stuck

### Check These First

1. **Netlify Function Logs**

   ```bash
   netlify functions:log
   # Or: https://app.netlify.com/sites/olms-4375-tw501-x421/logs/functions
   ```

2. **Supabase Database Health**

   ```bash
   curl https://xstlnicbnzdxlgfiewmg.supabase.co/rest/v1/
   # Should return 200 OK
   ```

3. **Environment Variables**
   ```bash
   netlify env:list
   # Verify all critical vars are set
   ```

### Common Issues

**"Missing Supabase environment variables"**
→ Env vars not set in Netlify (see Step 2 above)

**"Structure of query does not match function result type"**
→ Database migration not applied (see Step 1 above)

**"Rate limit exceeded"**
→ Wait 60 seconds or check Redis configuration

## 💾 Backup & Rollback

If recovery makes things worse:

```bash
# Rollback to previous deploy
# Go to: https://app.netlify.com/sites/olms-4375-tw501-x421/deploys
# Find: Last working deploy (before Oct 10, 2025)
# Click: "Publish deploy"
```
