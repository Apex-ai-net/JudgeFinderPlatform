## Deployment Workflow

### Step 1: Pre-Deployment Validation

```bash
# Validate environment variables
node -e "require('./lib/utils/env-validator').validateEnvironmentOnStartup()"

# Run tests
npm run test:ci

# Type check
npm run type-check

# Lint
npm run lint
```

### Step 2: Deploy

```bash
# Via Git (recommended)
git push origin main

# Or via Netlify CLI
netlify deploy --prod
```

### Step 3: Post-Deployment Verification

```bash
# Run deployment verification script
DEPLOY_URL=https://judgefinder.io ./scripts/verify-deployment.sh

# Run smoke tests
PROD_URL=https://judgefinder.io npx playwright test tests/smoke/production.spec.ts

# Send notification
DEPLOY_HOOK_URL=https://hooks.slack.com/... ts-node scripts/notify-deployment.ts
```

### Step 4: Manual Verification

1. Visit https://judgefinder.io
2. Perform a search
3. View a judge profile
4. Check authentication flow
5. Review monitoring dashboard: https://judgefinder.io/admin/deployments

### Step 5: Monitoring

- Check Sentry for errors
- Monitor health endpoint: https://judgefinder.io/api/health
- Watch analytics for traffic patterns
- Review server logs in Netlify dashboard
