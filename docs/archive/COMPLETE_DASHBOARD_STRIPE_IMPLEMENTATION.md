## 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

### Backend API Routes

#### 1. Customer Portal

```typescript
POST /api/billing/customer-portal
→ Creates Stripe portal session
→ Returns portal URL for redirect
→ Validates user owns advertiser profile
→ Requires active Stripe customer ID
```

#### 2. Subscriptions Data

```typescript
GET /api/billing/subscriptions
→ Fetches live Stripe subscription data
→ Returns subscriptions + payment methods
→ Validates authentication
→ Handles users without Stripe customers gracefully
```

### Helper Functions

#### lib/billing/subscriptions.ts

- `getUserSubscriptions()` - Fetches all subscriptions
- `getPaymentMethods()` - Fetches payment methods with expiration checks
- `getInvoices()` - Fetches invoice history (ready for future use)
- `isExpiringSoon()` - Detects cards expiring within 3 months

### Security Measures

- ✅ Server-side only Stripe API calls
- ✅ Authentication required for all endpoints
- ✅ User ownership validation via RLS
- ✅ Proper error handling and logging
- ✅ Rate limiting on checkout endpoints

## 🎯 How It Works

### Billing Flow for Advertisers

1. **User makes purchase** → Stripe Checkout
2. **Stripe creates customer** → Saved to `advertiser_profiles.stripe_customer_id`
3. **Subscription created** → Managed by Stripe
4. **User visits `/dashboard/billing`**:
   - Clicks "Manage Subscriptions & Payment Methods"
   - Redirected to Stripe Customer Portal
   - Can cancel, modify, update payment methods, download invoices
   - Returns to `/dashboard/billing` when done

5. **Dashboard displays**:
   - Active subscriptions from Stripe API
   - Payment methods with expiration warnings
   - Purchase history from `ad_orders` table
