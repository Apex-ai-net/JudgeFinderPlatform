### Detailed Steps

See `/docs/AUTH_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` for comprehensive step-by-step instructions.

## Testing Checklist

### Critical Paths to Test

#### AI Chat Flow ✅ CRITICAL

- [ ] Anonymous user sees "Sign In Required"
- [ ] Sign-in redirects back to chat
- [ ] First message triggers Turnstile
- [ ] Message sends after CAPTCHA
- [ ] 21st message hits rate limit

#### Rate Limiting ✅ CRITICAL

- [ ] Anonymous: 10 searches/day limit
- [ ] Authenticated: 100 searches/hour limit
- [ ] Chat: 20 messages/hour limit
- [ ] Proper 429 error responses

#### Advertiser Onboarding ⚠️ IMPORTANT

- [ ] Unauthenticated redirects to sign-in
- [ ] Form validation works
- [ ] Turnstile CAPTCHA required
- [ ] Duplicate bar number rejected
- [ ] Success flow completes
- [ ] Database role updated

#### Security 🔒 CRITICAL

- [ ] Direct API access blocked without auth
- [ ] Invalid Turnstile token rejected
- [ ] SQL injection prevented
- [ ] XSS sanitized

## Rollback Plan

### Option 1: Netlify Dashboard (Fastest)

1. Go to Deploys tab
2. Find previous working deploy
3. Click "Publish deploy"
4. Rollback completes in ~30 seconds

### Option 2: Git Revert

```bash
git revert HEAD
git push origin main
```

### Option 3: Disable Features

```bash
# Disable Turnstile temporarily
netlify env:unset NEXT_PUBLIC_TURNSTILE_SITE_KEY
netlify env:unset TURNSTILE_SECRET_KEY
netlify deploy --prod
```

### Database Rollback (Last Resort)

```sql
-- Only if absolutely necessary!
ALTER TABLE users DROP COLUMN user_role CASCADE;
ALTER TABLE users DROP COLUMN bar_number CASCADE;
-- ... (see full script in deployment guide)
```

---

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk ✅

- Turnstile integration (fallback to dev mode if misconfigured)
- Rate limiting (graceful degradation without Redis)
- UI changes (no breaking changes)

### Medium Risk ⚠️

- Database migration (reversible, but requires careful testing)
- Authentication gate (may reduce chat engagement)
- Route protection (could block legitimate users if misconfigured)

### Mitigation Strategies

1. **Database:** Test migration on copy of production data first
2. **Auth Gate:** Monitor conversion rates, prepare to adjust if drop-off too high
3. **Route Protection:** Extensive testing of auth flows before deployment
4. **Rollback Ready:** Keep previous deploy ready to restore instantly

---

## Known Limitations & Future Enhancements

### Current Limitations

1. **Bar verification is auto-approved** (format validation only)
   - No actual State Bar API integration yet
   - Trust but verify approach

2. **Rate limits are fixed** (not adaptive)
   - Cannot adjust per-user based on behavior
   - Future: Implement risk-based throttling

3. **CAPTCHA on every first message** (could be intrusive)
   - Future: Risk-based CAPTCHA (only show for suspicious activity)

### Planned Enhancements

- [ ] Integrate actual State Bar API for real-time verification
- [ ] Add admin dashboard for managing advertiser applications
- [ ] Implement email notifications for verification status
- [ ] Create analytics dashboard for rate limiting insights
- [ ] Add risk-based CAPTCHA (adaptive bot detection)
- [ ] Support for manual admin review of bar verifications

---

## Communication Plan

### Internal Team

- [ ] Notify development team of deployment
- [ ] Brief support team on new features
- [ ] Update internal documentation
- [ ] Schedule post-mortem review

### Users

- [ ] Update help docs with authentication info
- [ ] Create FAQ: "Why do I need to sign in?"
- [ ] Publish advertiser onboarding guide
- [ ] Monitor feedback channels

### Stakeholders

- [ ] Report deployment completion
- [ ] Share initial metrics after 24 hours
- [ ] Weekly progress updates
- [ ] Month 1 comprehensive review

## Support & Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue:** Turnstile not appearing
**Fix:** Check `NEXT_PUBLIC_TURNSTILE_SITE_KEY` is set and starts with `0x`

**Issue:** Rate limiting not working
**Fix:** Verify Upstash Redis credentials, check connection

**Issue:** Bar verification fails
**Fix:** Check database migration applied, verify trigger exists

**Issue:** Authentication redirect loop
**Fix:** Check Clerk configuration, verify middleware rules

See `/docs/AUTH_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` for detailed troubleshooting.
