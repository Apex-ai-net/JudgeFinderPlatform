## Technical Architecture

### Component Structure

```
app/dashboard/advertiser/
├── campaigns/
│   └── page.tsx (Campaign Management Page)
├── performance/
│   └── page.tsx (Performance Analytics Page)
└── page.tsx (Main Dashboard - existing)

components/dashboard/advertiser/

├── CampaignCard.tsx (Individual campaign UI)
├── CreateCampaignDialog.tsx (Modal for creating)
├── EditCampaignDialog.tsx (Modal for editing)
└── PerformanceAnalyticsDashboard.tsx (Analytics logic)
```

### State Management
- **Client-Side State**: React useState for local state
- **API Integration**: Fetch API with error handling
- **Data Flow**: Server-rendered pages → Client components → API routes

### Authentication Flow
1. Page-level auth check (Clerk `currentUser()`)
2. Redirect to sign-in if unauthenticated
3. Verify advertiser profile exists
4. Redirect to onboarding if not verified
5. Pass user context to client components
