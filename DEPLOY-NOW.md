## 🚀 DEPLOYMENT STEPS

### Option A: Deploy via Netlify (RECOMMENDED)

```bash
# 1. Ensure you're on main branch with latest changes
git status
git pull origin main

# 2. Push to trigger Netlify deployment
git push origin main

# 3. Monitor deployment
open https://app.netlify.com/sites/judgefinder/deploys

# 4. Verify deployment completed
# Should see: "Published" status with green checkmark
```

### Option B: Deploy via Netlify CLI

```bash
# 1. Install Netlify CLI (if not installed)
npm install -g netlify-cli

# 2. Login to Netlify
netlify login

# 3. Deploy to production
netlify deploy --prod

# 4. Confirm deployment
# Navigate to: https://judgefinder.io
```

### Option C: Use MCP Tools (Automated)

I can trigger the deployment for you using Netlify MCP tools if you'd like!

## 🧪 POST-DEPLOYMENT VERIFICATION (15 minutes)

### 1. Smoke Test Critical Endpoints ✅

```bash
# Test judge search (public endpoint)
curl https://judgefinder.io/api/judges/search?q=smith
# Expected: 200 OK with judge results

# Test judge profile (public endpoint)
curl https://judgefinder.io/api/judges/by-slug/[judge-slug]
# Expected: 200 OK with judge details

# Test admin endpoint (should be protected)
curl https://judgefinder.io/api/admin/stats
# Expected: 401 Unauthorized (no auth header)

# Test health check
curl https://judgefinder.io/api/health
# Expected: 200 OK with status: "healthy"
```

### 2. Verify RLS Enforcement ✅

```bash
# Connect to Supabase
psql $DATABASE_URL

# Check RLS is enabled on all tables
SELECT schemaname, tablename, rowsecurity
FROM pg_tables
WHERE schemaname = 'public'
  AND rowsecurity = false
  AND tablename NOT LIKE 'pg_%';
-- Expected: 0 rows

# Check policies exist
SELECT schemaname, tablename, COUNT(*) as policy_count
FROM pg_policies
WHERE schemaname = 'public'
GROUP BY schemaname, tablename
ORDER BY policy_count DESC;
-- Expected: 17+ tables with policies
```

### 3. Monitor Logs (First 2 Hours) ✅

**Supabase Logs:**

```
https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/xstlnicbnzdxlgfiewmg/logs/postgres
```

Watch for:

- ❌ RLS policy violations (should be ZERO)
- ❌ Permission denied errors (investigate if any)
- ✅ Normal query activity

**Netlify Logs:**

```
https://app.netlify.com/sites/judgefinder/logs
```

Watch for:

- ❌ Function errors (investigate if spike)
- ❌ Timeout errors (normal: < 2%)
- ✅ 200 OK responses (target: > 95%)

**Sentry Dashboard:**

```
https://sentry.io/organizations/[your-org]/projects/judgefinder/
```

Watch for:

- ❌ Unhandled exceptions (investigate immediately)
- ❌ API errors (normal: < 2%)
- ✅ Performance metrics (p95 < 1000ms)

### 4. Test User Flows ✅

**Anonymous User (Public Access):**

- [ ] Search for judges
- [ ] View judge profile
- [ ] View court listings
- [ ] Cannot access admin routes
- [ ] Cannot access user bookmarks

**Authenticated User:**

- [ ] Sign in with Clerk
- [ ] Search for judges
- [ ] Bookmark a judge
- [ ] View saved bookmarks
- [ ] Cannot access admin routes

**Admin User:**

- [ ] Sign in as admin
- [ ] Access admin dashboard
- [ ] View system stats
- [ ] Cannot be blocked by RLS policies

---

## ⚠️ ROLLBACK PROCEDURE (If Needed)

### If Critical Issues Found:

1. **Immediate Rollback:**

```bash
# Via Netlify Dashboard
# Go to: https://app.netlify.com/sites/judgefinder/deploys
# Find last working deploy
# Click "Publish deploy" on that version
```

2. **Enable Maintenance Mode:**

```bash
# Set environment variable via Netlify
netlify env:set MAINTENANCE_MODE true

# Or via dashboard:
# Settings → Environment Variables → Add MAINTENANCE_MODE=true
```

3. **Investigate Issue:**

- Check Supabase logs for RLS errors
- Check Sentry for exceptions
- Check Netlify logs for function errors

4. **Common Issues & Fixes:**

**RLS Policy Violation:**

```sql
-- Temporarily disable RLS on problematic table (EMERGENCY ONLY)
ALTER TABLE public.[table_name] DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Fix policy, then re-enable
ALTER TABLE public.[table_name] ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
```

**Service Role Key Issue:**

- Verify `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` is set correctly in Netlify
- Check key hasn't expired or been revoked

**Database Connection:**

- Check Supabase project status
- Verify `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` is correct
