## Testing Procedures

### Manual Testing Script

**Location:** `/scripts/test-email-system.ts`

**Usage:**

```bash
# Test single email type
npx tsx scripts/test-email-system.ts [email-type] [organization-id]

# Available email types:
# - payment-success
# - payment-failed
# - dunning-reminder
# - dunning-urgent
# - dunning-final
# - subscription-cancelled
# - usage-report
# - all (sends all 7 types)

# Examples:
npx tsx scripts/test-email-system.ts payment-success org_test123
npx tsx scripts/test-email-system.ts all org_test123
```

**Prerequisites:**

1. Organization exists in database with valid billing_email
2. Environment variables set (SENDGRID_API_KEY, SENDGRID_FROM_EMAIL)
3. Sender email verified in SendGrid

**Expected Output:**

```
ðŸ“§ Email System Test
Organization ID: org_test123
Email Type: payment-success

ðŸ§ª Testing Payment Success Email...
âœ… Payment Success Email sent!

ðŸ“Š Check email_send_log table in Supabase for delivery status.
ðŸ“¬ Check your inbox (billing email for organization) for the email.
```

### Database Verification

```sql
-- Check recent emails
SELECT
  email_to,
  email_subject,
  status,
  metadata->>'provider' as provider,
  metadata->>'category' as category,
  created_at
FROM email_send_log
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- Expected results:
-- status: 'sent'
-- provider: 'sendgrid'
-- category: 'payment-success', 'dunning-urgent', etc.

-- Check for errors
SELECT * FROM email_send_log
WHERE status = 'error'
ORDER BY created_at DESC;

-- Should be empty (no errors)
```

### Stripe Webhook Testing

```bash
# Install Stripe CLI
brew install stripe/stripe-cli/stripe

# Login to Stripe
stripe login

# Forward webhooks to local or production
stripe listen --forward-to https://judgefinder.io/api/webhooks/stripe

# In another terminal, trigger events
stripe trigger invoice.payment_succeeded
stripe trigger invoice.payment_failed
stripe trigger customer.subscription.deleted

# Check Netlify function logs for webhook processing
# Check email_send_log for new entries
```

   SELECT
     metadata->>'category' as category,
     status,
     COUNT(*) as count
   FROM email_send_log
   WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days'
   GROUP BY category, status
   ORDER BY count DESC;

   -- Delivery success rate
   SELECT
     status,
     COUNT(*) as count,
     ROUND(COUNT(*)::numeric / SUM(COUNT(*)) OVER () * 100, 2) as percentage
   FROM email_send_log
   WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days'
   GROUP BY status;
   ```

3. **Netlify Function Logs**
   - Netlify Dashboard â†’ Functions tab

## Security Best Practices

### API Key Security

1. **Never Commit to Git**
   - API keys excluded from version control
   - Stored only in Netlify environment variables
   - Added to `.gitignore` (`.env.local` pattern)

2. **Rotate Regularly**
   - Schedule: Every 90 days (quarterly)
   - Process:
     1. Generate new key in SendGrid
     2. Update Netlify variable
     3. Trigger redeploy
     4. Verify working
     5. Delete old key

3. **Use Separate Keys**
   - Development: Restricted test key
   - Production: Full access production key
   - Never use production key in development

4. **Monitor Usage**
   - SendGrid Dashboard â†’ API Keys
   - Review activity logs
   - Set up alerts for unusual activity

### Email Content Security

1. **Data Protection**
   - Never include passwords
   - Never include full credit card numbers
   - Sanitize all user-generated content
   - Escape HTML special characters

2. **Link Security**
   - All links use HTTPS
   - Billing portal: `https://judgefinder.io/dashboard/billing`
   - Invoice URLs from Stripe (always HTTPS)

3. **Rate Limiting**
   - Max 10 emails per organization per day
   - Exponential backoff for failures
   - Duplicate prevention in dunning manager
