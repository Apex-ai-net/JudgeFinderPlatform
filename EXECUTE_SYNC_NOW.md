# 🚀 Execute Judge Data Sync - Action Plan

**Ready to Run** | **Estimated Time: 12-14 hours total**

---

## ✅ What's Ready

- All sync scripts created and tested
- Rate limiting configured (600/hour, well under 5,000 limit)
- Error handling with exponential backoff
- UI components ready to display data
- NPM commands configured

---

## 🎯 3-Step Execution

### STEP 1: Add Missing Database Column (5 minutes)

**Action Required:** Run this SQL in your Supabase dashboard

1. Go to https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. Select your project
3. Navigate to **SQL Editor**
4. Click **New Query**
5. Paste and run:

```sql
-- Add political_affiliation column
ALTER TABLE judges
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS political_affiliation VARCHAR(100);

-- Add performance index
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_judges_political_affiliation
  ON judges(political_affiliation)
  WHERE political_affiliation IS NOT NULL;

-- Verify success
SELECT column_name, data_type
FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_name = 'judges'
  AND column_name = 'political_affiliation';
```

**Expected Output:**
```
column_name           | data_type
----------------------+------------------
political_affiliation | character varying
```

---

### STEP 2: Test Sync (20 minutes)

**Run this command in your terminal:**

```bash
npm run sync:all -- --limit=10
```

**What this does:**
- Syncs 10 judges' education data
- Waits 5 minutes
- Syncs 10 judges' political affiliation
- Waits 5 minutes
- Syncs 10 judges' position history

**Expected Output:**
```
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
📊 MASTER SYNC COMPLETE
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

📚 Education:
   ✅ Updated: 8-10
   ⏭️  Skipped: 0-2
   ❌ Errors: 0

🎉 Political Affiliation:
   ✅ Updated: 5-8
   ⏭️  Skipped: 2-5
   ❌ Errors: 0

📋 Position History:
   ✅ Updated: 8-10
   ⏭️  Skipped: 0-2
   ❌ Errors: 0

📊 Total Judges Updated: 21-28
❌ Total Errors: 0
```

**If test succeeds:** Proceed to Step 3
**If test fails:** Check error messages, verify Step 1 completed

---

### STEP 3: Full Sync (12 hours)

**Run this command:**

```bash
npm run sync:all
```

**What this does:**
- Syncs ~1,649 judges' education data (~70 mins)
- Waits 5 minutes
- Syncs ~1,903 judges' political affiliation (~80 mins)
- Waits 5 minutes
- Syncs ~1,903 judges' position history (~80 mins)

**Total Time:** ~12 hours with conservative rate limiting

**Pro Tip:** Run this in a `screen` or `tmux` session so it continues if you disconnect:

```bash
# Start a screen session
screen -S judge-sync

# Run the sync
npm run sync:all

# Detach: Press Ctrl+A, then D
# Reattach later: screen -r judge-sync
```

**Or run in background:**

```bash
nohup npm run sync:all > sync.log 2>&1 &

# Check progress
tail -f sync.log
```

---

## 📊 Monitor Progress

### During Sync

**Watch the console for:**
- "Processing batch X/Y" messages
- Success/skip/error counts
- Rate limit warnings (should auto-retry)

**Example output:**
```
📚 PHASE 1: Education Data
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
[2025-10-24T18:30:15.123Z] INFO: Processing batch 1/165
[2025-10-24T18:30:20.456Z] INFO: Updated judge education | Context: {"judgeId":"...","name":"Judge Smith","schoolCount":2}
[2025-10-24T18:30:22.789Z] INFO: Updated judge education | Context: {"judgeId":"...","name":"Judge Jones","schoolCount":1}
...
✅ Education sync complete
   Updated: 1,450
   Skipped: 199
   Errors: 0
```

### After Sync

**Quick check:**

```bash
npx tsx scripts/analyze-judge-completeness.ts
```

**Expected results:**
```
📊 Judge Data Completeness Summary
═══════════════════════════════════════════

✅ Education: 85% (1,618/1,903)
✅ Political Affiliation: 75% (1,427/1,903)
✅ Position History: 80% (1,522/1,903)

Overall Health Score: 80% ✅
```

## 🎨 Verify UI

### Check Judge Profiles

1. Go to any judge profile: `https://judgefinder.io/judges/[judge-slug]`
2. Look for **Professional Background** section
3. Verify you see:

**Education:**
```
🎓 Education
  Harvard Law School (J.D., 1995)
  Yale University (B.A., 1992)
```

**Political Affiliation:**
```
🎉 Political Affiliation
  Democratic (appointed by Biden, 2021)
```

**Position History:**
```
📋 Career Timeline
  2021-Present | U.S. District Court, Central District of California | District Judge
  2018-2021    | California Superior Court, Los Angeles | Judge
  2015-2018    | Private Practice | Partner
```

---

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### "Column political_affiliation does not exist"

**Fix:** Go back to Step 1 and run the SQL migration

**Verify:**
```bash
npx tsx scripts/add-political-affiliation-column.ts
```

### Rate Limit Errors (429)

**This is normal!** The script will automatically:
- Back off exponentially
- Wait up to 16 minutes
- Retry up to 5 times

**To reduce rate limit hits:**
- Run during off-peak hours (evening/night)
- Increase delays in the script (edit `delayMs`)

### No Data Being Updated

**Check CourtListener IDs exist:**
```bash
# Should return ~1,903
npx tsx -e "
import { createClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js';
const supabase = createClient(process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL, process.env.SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY);
supabase.from('judges').select('id', { count: 'exact', head: true }).not('courtlistener_id', 'is', null).then(r => console.log(r.count));
"
```

### Sync Stalls/Hangs

**If no progress for >30 minutes:**
1. Check your internet connection
2. Check CourtListener API status: https://www.courtlistener.com
3. Ctrl+C to cancel
4. Re-run sync (it will skip already-synced judges)

## 📈 Expected Results

### Data Completeness Improvements

| Field | Before | After | Improvement |
|-------|--------|-------|-------------|
| Education | 13.3% | ~85% | +71.7% |
| Political Affiliation | 0% | ~75% | +75% |
| Position History | 0% | ~80% | +80% |
| **Overall** | ~4.4% | **~80%** | **+75.6%** |

### Judge Profiles Enhanced

- **Before:** Minimal biographical data
- **After:** Rich profiles with education, politics, career history

### Search Improvements

Political affiliation will be searchable via the search vector:
```sql
-- Find Democratic judges
SELECT name, political_affiliation
FROM judges
WHERE search_vector @@ to_tsquery('Democratic')
LIMIT 10;
```

---

## 🎯 Success Criteria

✅ **All three syncs complete with <5% errors**
✅ **Education data: 80%+ judges populated**
✅ **Political affiliation: 70%+ judges populated**
✅ **Position history: 70%+ judges populated**
✅ **UI displays all three data types correctly**
✅ **Search includes political affiliation**

---

## Next Steps After Sync

1. ✅ Run completeness analysis
2. ✅ Spot-check 10 random judge profiles
3. ✅ Test search with political affiliation keywords
4. ✅ Monitor error logs for any issues
5. ✅ Schedule weekly re-sync to catch new judges

**Weekly re-sync:**
```bash
# Add to crontab or scheduler
0 2 * * 0 cd /path/to/project && npm run sync:all
```
