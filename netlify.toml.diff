NETLIFY.TOML CHANGES SUMMARY
===================================

CHANGE 1: NPM_FLAGS
  FROM: --include=dev --legacy-peer-deps
  TO:   --legacy-peer-deps
  WHY:  Prevent eslint and other dev tools from running in CI.
        This stops eslint-report.json generation and reduces attack surface.
  RISK: Type-checking may fail if @types/* are dev dependencies.
        MITIGATION: Move necessary @types to 'dependencies' if needed.

CHANGE 2: SECRETS_SCAN_OMIT_PATHS
  FROM: .netlify/**,.next/**,node_modules/**,.git/**
  TO:   .netlify/cache/**,.next/cache/**,node_modules/**,.git/**
  WHY:  Only exclude cache directories, not entire .next build output.
        This ensures bundled code in .next is scanned for secrets.
  NOTE: If eslint-report.json gets regenerated, it WILL be scanned (good!).

CHANGE 3: CI environment variable
  ADDED: CI=true in all contexts
  WHY:  Allows scripts to detect CI environment and abort if they require
        secrets or are dev-only (see fix.patch script guards).

CHANGE 4: Comment clarifications
  ADDED: Inline rationale for each configuration choice
  WHY:  Prevent future developers from "fixing" the config back to insecure state.

===================================
VALIDATION CHECKLIST
===================================

After applying this patch:

1. ✅ NPM_FLAGS no longer includes --include=dev
2. ✅ Secrets scanning remains ENABLED (SECRETS_SCAN_ENABLED not set to false)
3. ✅ Only safe, non-secret keys in SECRETS_SCAN_OMIT_KEYS
4. ✅ Only cache paths in SECRETS_SCAN_OMIT_PATHS (build output still scanned)
5. ✅ CI=true set in all build contexts
6. ✅ Comments explain WHY each choice was made

===================================
TESTING
===================================

To test locally before deploying:

1. Set environment variable:
   export CI=true

2. Run build:
   npm run build

3. Verify scripts abort with CI guard:
   node scripts/analyze-db-direct.js
   # Should print: "❌ This script cannot run in CI environments"

4. Verify eslint does NOT generate report:
   npm run lint
   ls -lh eslint-report.json  # Should not exist

5. If type-check fails due to missing @types:
   npm install --save @types/react @types/node
   # Move from devDependencies to dependencies
