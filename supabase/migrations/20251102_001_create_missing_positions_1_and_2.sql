-- POST-MIGRATION NOTES
-- =============================================================================
--
-- What This Migration Does:
-- 1. Creates position 1 ad_spots for all judges (1903 expected)
-- 2. Creates position 2 ad_spots for all judges (1903 expected)
-- 3. Verifies all judges now have exactly 3 ad_spots (1, 2, and 3)
--
-- Expected Result:
-- - Before: 1903 ad_spots (only position 3)
-- - After: 5709 ad_spots (1903 judges Ã— 3 positions)
--
-- Verification Query:
--   SELECT position, COUNT(*) as count
--   FROM ad_spots
--   WHERE entity_type = 'judge'
--   GROUP BY position
--   ORDER BY position;
--   -- Should return:
--   -- position | count
--   -- ---------+-------
--   --     1    | 1903
--   --     2    | 1903
--   --     3    | 1903
