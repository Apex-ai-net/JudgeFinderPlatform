## 🎓 Lessons Learned & Best Practices

### From Recent Work (Oct 17 Security Session)

✅ **What Worked:**
- MCP tools for direct database access
- Systematic fix prioritization (critical → high → medium)
- Documentation created during fixes (not after)
- Verification after each phase

⚠️ **Challenges:**
- Security definer views required deep Postgres knowledge
- RLS policy design needed careful 4-tier access model
- Some tools timed out on large codebase

### Recommendations for This Plan

1. **Fix TypeScript errors FIRST** - Everything depends on clean builds
2. **Use TodoWrite tool** - Track progress systematically
3. **Create migrations incrementally** - Don't batch too many changes
4. **Test on staging with production data** - Catches real-world issues
5. **Document decisions** - Future Claude instances need context
