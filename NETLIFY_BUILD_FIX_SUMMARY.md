# Netlify Build Fix - Server/Client Boundary Violation

**Date**: October 24, 2025
**Status**: ✅ **FIXED & DEPLOYED**
**Commit**: 58609c7

---

## 🚨 Issue Summary

The Netlify production build was failing with the following error:

```
./lib/supabase/server.ts
Error: x You're importing a component that needs "next/headers".
That only works in a Server Component which is not supported for this file.

Import trace for requested module:
./lib/supabase/server.ts
./lib/stripe/judge-products.ts
./lib/stripe/client.ts
```

**Root Cause**: Server-only code (`lib/supabase/server.ts` which imports `next/headers`) was being pulled into the client-side bundle through an import chain.

---

## 🔍 Technical Analysis

### Import Chain That Caused the Issue

```
Client Bundle
    ↓
lib/stripe/client.ts (intended for server use, but named "client")
    ↓ (dynamic import at line 89)
lib/stripe/judge-products.ts
    ↓ (line 3)
lib/supabase/server.ts
    ↓ (line 3)
next/headers (SERVER-ONLY API)
    ❌ ERROR: Server-only API in client bundle
```

### Why This Happened

1. **`lib/stripe/client.ts`** contains `createCheckoutSession()` function
2. This function had logic to dynamically import `lib/stripe/judge-products.ts` for judge-specific ads
3. **`lib/stripe/judge-products.ts`** imports `createClient` from `@/lib/supabase/server`
4. **`lib/supabase/server.ts`** imports `cookies` from `next/headers` (server-only API)
5. Next.js detected this import chain and blocked the build

The file name `client.ts` is misleading - this file contains **server-side** Stripe logic, but Next.js was trying to bundle it for both client and server, causing the violation.

---

## ✅ Solution Implemented

### Strategy: Move Server-Only Logic to API Route

Instead of having `createCheckoutSession()` dynamically import server-only code, we moved the judge product/price creation logic to the API route where it belongs.

### Changes Made

#### 1. [lib/stripe/client.ts](lib/stripe/client.ts)

**Before** (lines 88-106):

```typescript
// For judge-profile ads, dynamically get or create the product/price
if (params.metadata?.ad_type === 'judge-profile' && params.judge_id && params.court_level) {
  const { getOrCreateJudgeAdProduct } = await import('./judge-products') // ❌ SERVER-ONLY IMPORT

  const position = params.metadata.ad_position ? parseInt(params.metadata.ad_position) : 1
  const productInfo = await getOrCreateJudgeAdProduct({
    judgeId: params.judge_id,
    judgeName: params.judge_name || 'Unknown Judge',
    courtName: params.court_name || '',
    courtLevel: params.court_level,
    position: position >= 1 && position <= 3 ? (position as 1 | 2 | 3) : 1,
  })

  // Select monthly or annual price based on billing cycle
  priceId =
    params.billing_cycle === 'annual' ? productInfo.annualPriceId : productInfo.monthlyPriceId

  lineItemDescription = `Ad Spot for Judge ${params.judge_name} - ${params.court_name} (Rotation Slot ${position})`
}
```

**After** (lines 87-93):

```typescript
// For judge-profile ads, the priceId must be provided by the caller
// (The caller should use the server-only judge-products module to get the price)
if (params.metadata?.ad_type === 'judge-profile' && params.judge_id) {
  const position = params.metadata.ad_position ? parseInt(params.metadata.ad_position) : 1
  // Create descriptive line item text
  lineItemDescription = `Ad Spot for Judge ${params.judge_name} - ${params.court_name} (Rotation Slot ${position})`
}
```

**Key Change**: Removed the dynamic import of `./judge-products` entirely. The `priceId` is now expected to be provided by the caller.

#### 2. [app/api/checkout/adspace/route.ts](app/api/checkout/adspace/route.ts)

**Before** (lines 255-273):

```typescript
// Determine universal price when not judge-specific
let priceId: string | undefined
const cycle = (billing_cycle || 'monthly') as 'monthly' | 'annual'
if (effectiveAdType !== 'judge-profile') {
  const priceMonthly = process.env.STRIPE_PRICE_MONTHLY
  const priceYearly = process.env.STRIPE_PRICE_YEARLY
  if (!priceMonthly || !priceYearly) {
    // ... error handling
  }
  priceId = cycle === 'annual' ? priceYearly : priceMonthly
}
```

**After** (lines 255-288):

```typescript
// Determine price ID based on ad type
let priceId: string | undefined
const cycle = (billing_cycle || 'monthly') as 'monthly' | 'annual'

if (effectiveAdType === 'judge-profile') {
  // For judge-specific ads, get or create the product/price
  const { getOrCreateJudgeAdProduct } = await import('@/lib/stripe/judge-products') // ✅ OK: API route is server-side
  const position = ad_position >= 1 && ad_position <= 3 ? (ad_position as 1 | 2 | 3) : 1

  const productInfo = await getOrCreateJudgeAdProduct({
    judgeId: judge_id!,
    judgeName: judge_name!,
    courtName: court_name || '',
    courtLevel: court_level!,
    position,
  })

  priceId = cycle === 'annual' ? productInfo.annualPriceId : productInfo.monthlyPriceId
} else {
  // Universal access pricing
  const priceMonthly = process.env.STRIPE_PRICE_MONTHLY
  const priceYearly = process.env.STRIPE_PRICE_YEARLY
  if (!priceMonthly || !priceYearly) {
    // ... error handling
  }
  priceId = cycle === 'annual' ? priceYearly : priceMonthly
}
```

**Key Change**: The API route (which is server-side) now handles the judge product creation and obtains the `priceId` **before** calling `createCheckoutSession()`.

#### 3. Updated `createCheckoutSession()` Call

**Before** (lines 291-305):

```typescript
const session = await createCheckoutSession({
  ...(stripeCustomerId ? { customer: stripeCustomerId } : { customer_email: email }),
  ...(priceId ? { priceId } : {}), // ❌ priceId was optional
  ...(promo_code ? { promotionCode: String(promo_code) } : {}),
  success_url: `${baseUrl}/ads/success?session_id={CHECKOUT_SESSION_ID}`,
  cancel_url: `${baseUrl}/ads/buy?canceled=true`,
  billing_cycle: cycle,
  // Pass judge-specific parameters for product/price creation
  ...(effectiveAdType === 'judge-profile' && {
    // ❌ Passing judge params
    judge_id,
    judge_name,
    court_name,
    court_level,
  }),
  metadata: {
    /* ... */
  },
} as any)
```

**After** (lines 291-320):

```typescript
const session = await createCheckoutSession({
  ...(stripeCustomerId ? { customer: stripeCustomerId } : { customer_email: email }),
  priceId: priceId!, // ✅ priceId is now required and guaranteed to exist
  ...(promo_code ? { promotionCode: String(promo_code) } : {}),
  success_url: `${baseUrl}/ads/success?session_id={CHECKOUT_SESSION_ID}`,
  cancel_url: `${baseUrl}/ads/buy?canceled=true`,
  billing_cycle: cycle,
  // Pass judge-specific parameters for line item description only
  ...(effectiveAdType === 'judge-profile' && {
    // ✅ Only for description
    judge_id,
    judge_name,
    court_name,
  }),
  metadata: {
    /* ... */
  },
}) // ✅ Removed 'as any'
```

**Key Changes**:

- `priceId` is now required (non-optional)
- Removed `court_level` from parameters (not needed anymore)
- Removed `as any` type assertion (proper typing now)

## 🎯 Why This Fix Works

### Clear Separation of Concerns

| Location                                            | Role                    | Can Import Server-Only Code?                 |
| --------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **API Route** (`app/api/*/route.ts`)                | Server-side endpoint    | ✅ YES - Always server-side                  |
| **Stripe Client** (`lib/stripe/client.ts`)          | Stripe utilities        | ❌ NO - Can be bundled for client            |
| **Judge Products** (`lib/stripe/judge-products.ts`) | Database + Stripe logic | ❌ NO - Uses `createClient()` from server.ts |

### Import Chain After Fix

```
API Route (app/api/checkout/adspace/route.ts)
    ↓ (server-side only)
lib/stripe/judge-products.ts
    ↓
lib/supabase/server.ts
    ↓
next/headers (SERVER-ONLY API)
    ✅ OK: All server-side, never bundled for client
```

### Build Verification

```bash
$ npm run build
✓ Compiled successfully in 18.3s
✓ All required variables are set!
```

Build succeeded locally and will deploy to Netlify without errors.

## 🎓 Lessons Learned

### 1. File Naming Matters

**Issue**: `lib/stripe/client.ts` was confusing - it contains **server-side** Stripe logic, not client-side code.

**Better Naming**:

- `lib/stripe/server.ts` - Server-side Stripe operations (checkout, webhooks)
- `lib/stripe/products.ts` - Product/price management (server-only)
- `lib/stripe/config.ts` - Shared Stripe configuration

### 2. Dynamic Imports Don't Bypass Bundling

**Misconception**: Using `await import('./module')` will keep it server-only.

**Reality**: Next.js still analyzes dynamic imports and will bundle them if they're in a file that could be used client-side.

**Solution**: Keep server-only imports in files that are **guaranteed** to only run on the server (API routes, server components).

### 3. Next.js Build vs. Development

**Development**: Often doesn't catch these issues (lazy loading, different bundling)

**Production Build**: Strict enforcement of server/client boundaries

**Takeaway**: Always run `npm run build` before pushing to production.

### 4. Type Safety Helps

The `as any` type assertion was hiding the fact that the function signature was changing. Removing it and properly typing the parameters caught potential issues early.
