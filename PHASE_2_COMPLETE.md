## Testing Checklist

### Manual Testing Required:

- [ ] Navigation between dashboard pages
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness
- [ ] Dark mode compatibility (where applicable)

### Integration Testing:

- [ ] Verify API endpoints return correct HTTP status codes
- [ ] Verify authentication guards on all protected routes

## Known Limitations & Future Enhancements

### Limitations:
1. **Bar Number Verification**: Currently validates format only, not against California State Bar API
2. **Payment Integration**: Billing information collected but Stripe payment method not set up
3. **Time-Series Charts**: Performance dashboard has placeholder for chart, not yet implemented
4. **Campaign Creation**: Dialog exists but needs integration with ad spot selection
5. **File Cleanup**: Uploaded logos are not automatically deleted when removed from profile

### Planned Enhancements (Future Phases):
1. **Phase 3**: Design system standardization (hardcoded colors → semantic tokens)
2. **Bar API Integration**: Real-time verification with California State Bar
3. **Stripe Setup Flow**: Add payment method during onboarding
4. **Chart Implementation**: Add time-series charts to performance dashboard (Chart.js or Recharts)
5. **Campaign Creation Flow**: Complete judge selection and ad spot booking
6. **Logo CDN**: Move uploaded files to cloud storage (Cloudinary, S3)
7. **Automated Testing**: Add Playwright tests for critical flows

---

## Performance Considerations

### Optimizations Applied:
- ✅ `force-dynamic` on all API routes (prevents stale data caching)
- ✅ Server-side data fetching with Supabase (reduces client bundle size)
- ✅ Ownership verification on all mutations (security)
- ✅ File size validation before upload (prevents large uploads)
- ✅ UUID-based filenames (prevents path traversal attacks)

### Potential Improvements:
- Image optimization (Next.js Image component for uploaded logos)
- Pagination for campaign lists (currently loads all campaigns)
- Debounced search input (reduce re-renders)
- Optimistic UI updates (show changes before API confirms)

2. Ensure consistent color palette across all pages
3. Improve dark mode support
4. Document color usage guidelines

**Estimated Files**: 20-25 files needing color token updates

1. **Onboard** with bar verification
2. **Create campaigns** with intuitive UI
3. **Track performance** with real-time metrics
4. **Manage ad creative** with logo upload and tagline editing
