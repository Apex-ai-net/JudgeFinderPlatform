## ‚ö° Performance Considerations

### Rate Limiting
- **CourtListener API:** 5,000 requests/hour
- **Our Configuration:** 1,440 requests/hour (safe margin)
- **Per-Request Delay:** 1000ms (configurable)
- **Backoff Strategy:** Exponential with jitter

### Database Indexes
‚úÖ Implemented on:
- `judges.courtlistener_id`
- `judges.jurisdiction`
- `judges.court_id`
- `courts.courtlistener_id`
- `courts.jurisdiction`
- `judge_analytics.judge_id`
- `sync_progress.judge_id`

### Caching Strategy
- Analytics pre-calculated and stored
- Dashboard statistics cached server-side
- Judge profiles include static metadata

---

## üêõ Known Issues & Workarounds

### Issue 1: CourtListener Rate Limits
**Problem:** Hitting 429 (Too Many Requests) during bulk import
**Workaround:** Orchestrator automatically backs off with exponential delay
**Solution:** Run imports during off-peak hours or in smaller batches

### Issue 2: Missing Education Data
**Problem:** Only 13.3% of judges have education records
**Workaround:** Dedicated sync script ready to run
**Solution:** Execute `sync-education-data.ts` with small batches

### Issue 3: Analytics Require Minimum Cases
**Problem:** Only 36.8% of judges have 500+ cases for full analytics
**Workaround:** Display available metrics, clearly indicate confidence
**Solution:** Continue case data enrichment via background sync
