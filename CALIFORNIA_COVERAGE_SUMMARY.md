## Critical Issues Identified

### 1. Amador County Data Anomaly (CRITICAL)

**Issue:** Amador County shows 483 judges - 48.3% of all California judges

**Facts:**
- Amador County population: ~40,000 (small rural county)
- Expected Superior Court judges: 1-3
- Actual count in database: 483
- All assigned to: "Superior Court of California, County of Amador"
- Import dates: August 13-14, 2025
- Duplicate rate: 0.62% (only 3 duplicates)

**Root Cause:**
CourtListener API incorrectly assigned 483 California judges to Amador County Superior Court during the initial data import.

**Impact:**
- Skewed county statistics
- Incorrect search results for Amador County
- Missing judges from their actual counties
- 480 judges need to be reassigned to correct courts

**Recommended Fix:**
1. Cross-reference CourtListener judge records with actual court assignments
2. Use position history to determine correct current court
3. Bulk update incorrect court assignments
4. Re-run county extraction after corrections

### 2. Missing Court Records (31 Counties)

**High-Priority Counties Missing Court Data:**
- Contra Costa (19 judges, no courts)
- Riverside (16 judges, no courts)
- Ventura (10 judges, no courts)
- Stanislaus (10 judges, no courts)
- Santa Barbara (11 judges, no courts)
- San Mateo (5 judges, no courts)

**Impact:**
- Incomplete court profiles
- Missing court contact information
- Unable to show all judges for a court
- Search functionality limited

### 3. Unmapped Judges (327 Total)

**Categories:**
- Federal Circuit/District Court judges: ~150
- California Supreme Court / Courts of Appeal: ~50
- Bankruptcy judges: ~40
- WCAB (Workers' Comp) judges: ~30
- Federal Magistrate judges: ~25
- Other administrative/specialty: ~32

**Issue:**
These judges serve multiple counties or state-wide, so county-based extraction fails.

**Impact:**
- Judges excluded from county-based searches
- Incomplete coverage statistics
- Missing from geographic filters

## Conclusion

**We have achieved 100% California county representation**, which is a major milestone. However, the Amador County data quality issue needs immediate attention, as nearly half of our California judges (483 out of 1,000) are incorrectly assigned.

Once the Amador County issue is resolved and court records are imported for the 31 counties currently lacking them, the platform will have robust, production-ready coverage of California's judicial system.

### Success Metrics

- ✓ All 58 counties have at least some data
- ✓ 100% CourtListener integration
- ✓ 1,000 California judges in database
- ⚠ 48% of judges need court reassignment (Amador fix)
- ⚠ 31 counties need court records
- ⚠ 22 counties need more judges

### Priority Order

1. **FIX AMADOR COUNTY** (Critical - affects 480 judges)
2. Import missing court records (High - affects 31 counties)
3. Handle state-wide/federal judges (Medium - affects 327 judges)
4. Expand low-coverage counties (Medium - affects 22 counties)
