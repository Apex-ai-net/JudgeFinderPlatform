## 🗄️ DATABASE MIGRATIONS (APPLY FIRST!)

### Migration Files to Apply

You have **2 new migration files** that MUST be applied in order:

#### 1. Bar Verifications Table

**File:** `supabase/migrations/20251024_001_bar_verifications_table.sql`
**Purpose:** Creates `bar_verifications` table for attorney verification workflow
**Risk:** LOW (new table, no data changes)

#### 2. Complete Base Schema RLS Policies

**File:** `supabase/migrations/20251024_complete_base_schema_rls_policies.sql`
**Purpose:** Adds 32 RLS policies for 6 base tables (users, attorneys, bookmarks, etc.)
**Risk:** LOW (additive only, no breaking changes)

---

## 🔧 HOW TO APPLY MIGRATIONS

### Option 1: Supabase Dashboard (RECOMMENDED - Easiest)

1. **Open Supabase Dashboard**
   - Go to https://app.supabase.com
   - Select your JudgeFinder project
   - Click "SQL Editor" in left sidebar

2. **Apply Migration 1: Bar Verifications**

   ```bash
   # Copy content from:
   supabase/migrations/20251024_001_bar_verifications_table.sql
   ```

   - Paste into SQL Editor
   - Click "Run" button
   - **Expected:** "Success. No rows returned"

3. **Apply Migration 2: RLS Policies**

   ```bash
   # Copy content from:
   supabase/migrations/20251024_complete_base_schema_rls_policies.sql
   ```

   - Paste into SQL Editor
   - Click "Run" button
   - **Expected:** "Success. 32 policies created"

4. **Verify Success**

   ```sql
   -- Run this query to verify:
   SELECT COUNT(*) as total_policies
   FROM pg_policies
   WHERE schemaname = 'public';

   -- Should return > 100 policies
   ```

### Option 2: Supabase CLI (Advanced)

If you have Supabase CLI configured:

```bash
# Link to remote project (if not already linked)
supabase link --project-ref YOUR_PROJECT_REF

# Apply migrations
supabase db push

# Verify
supabase db diff
```

### Option 3: Direct PostgreSQL (Expert Only)

If you have direct database access:

```bash
# Get connection string from Supabase Dashboard → Settings → Database
export DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres:[YOUR-PASSWORD]@[HOST]:[PORT]/postgres"

# Apply migrations in order
psql $DATABASE_URL < supabase/migrations/20251024_001_bar_verifications_table.sql
psql $DATABASE_URL < supabase/migrations/20251024_complete_base_schema_rls_policies.sql
```

---

## 🧪 POST-MIGRATION VERIFICATION

After applying migrations, run these queries in SQL Editor:

### 1. Verify bar_verifications Table Created

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM information_schema.tables
WHERE table_schema = 'public'
  AND table_name = 'bar_verifications';

-- Expected: 1
```

### 2. Verify RLS Policies Created

```sql
SELECT
  tablename,
  COUNT(*) as policy_count
FROM pg_policies
WHERE schemaname = 'public'
  AND tablename IN ('users', 'attorneys', 'attorney_slots', 'bookmarks', 'search_history', 'subscriptions')
GROUP BY tablename
ORDER BY tablename;

-- Expected:
-- attorneys: 6 policies
-- attorney_slots: 6 policies
-- bookmarks: 5 policies
-- search_history: 6 policies
-- subscriptions: 4 policies
-- users: 5 policies
```

### 3. Verify RLS is Enabled

```sql
SELECT
  schemaname,
  tablename,
  rowsecurity as rls_enabled
FROM pg_tables
WHERE schemaname = 'public'
  AND rowsecurity = false;

-- Expected: 0 rows (all tables should have RLS enabled)
```

### 4. Run Security Verification Script (OPTIONAL)

```bash
# This is a comprehensive check created by the Database Architect Agent
psql $DATABASE_URL < scripts/verify_database_security.sql
```

---

## ⚙️ ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

### New Variables Required

Add these to **Netlify Dashboard** → Site Settings → Environment Variables:

```env
# Email Service (SendGrid)
SENDGRID_API_KEY=SG.your_api_key_here
SENDGRID_FROM_EMAIL=billing@judgefinder.io

# Optional: Override default email addresses
# EMAIL_REPLY_TO=support@judgefinder.io
```

### How to Get SendGrid API Key

1. **Create SendGrid Account** (if you don't have one)
   - Go to https://signup.sendgrid.com/
   - Sign up for free tier (100 emails/day)

2. **Generate API Key**
   - Log in to SendGrid dashboard
   - Go to Settings → API Keys
   - Click "Create API Key"
   - Name: "JudgeFinder Production"
   - Permissions: "Full Access" (or "Mail Send" minimum)
   - **SAVE THE KEY IMMEDIATELY** (you won't see it again!)

3. **Verify Sender Email**
   - Go to Settings → Sender Authentication
   - Click "Verify a Single Sender"
   - Enter: billing@judgefinder.io
   - Check email and click verification link
   - **MUST BE VERIFIED** before sending emails

4. **Add to Netlify**
   - Netlify Dashboard → Site Settings → Environment Variables
   - Add `SENDGRID_API_KEY` = `SG.xxxxx...`
   - Add `SENDGRID_FROM_EMAIL` = `billing@judgefinder.io`

## 🚀 CODE DEPLOYMENT

### Step 1: Type Check and Build (Local Verification)

```bash
# Ensure you're in the project root
cd /Users/tanner-osterkamp/JudgeFinderPlatform

# Type check
npm run type-check

# Expected: ✓ No TypeScript errors

# Build
npm run build

# Expected: ✓ Build succeeded (may take 2-3 minutes)
```

### Step 2: Commit All Changes

```bash
# Stage all new files from agents
git add .

# Commit with comprehensive message
git commit -m "feat: ultrathink multi-agent implementation

   - Common issues:
     - TypeScript errors (run `npm run type-check` locally first)
     - Missing environment variables (check Netlify env vars)
     - Import errors (check file paths)
   - Fix locally, commit, and push again

4. **When Build Succeeds**
   - Status changes to "Published"
   - Click "Preview" to see the deployed site
   - Verify critical pages load

---

## ✅ POST-DEPLOYMENT VERIFICATION

### Immediate Checks (5 minutes)

curl -I https://judgefinder.io/attorneys
curl -I https://judgefinder.io/case-analytics
curl -I https://judgefinder.io/legal-research-tools
curl -I https://judgefinder.io/judicial-analytics

# Check a specific jurisdiction page
curl -I https://judgefinder.io/attorneys/los-angeles-county
```

#### 2. Verify API Caching

```bash
# Should see Cache-Control header
curl -I https://judgefinder.io/api/courts?jurisdiction=CA | grep -i cache

# Expected: Cache-Control: public, s-maxage=3600, stale-while-revalidate=86400
```

#### 3. Check Sitemap Updated

```bash
# Should include new attorney/case-analytics pages

# Expected: > 50 (one for each jurisdiction)
```

#### 4. Test Health Endpoint

```bash
# Should return { "status": "healthy" }
curl https://judgefinder.io/api/health | jq
```

### In-Depth Verification (30 minutes)

#### 1. Test Bar Verification Flow

- Go to advertiser signup page
- Enter test bar number: `123456`
- Submit verification request
- Check database: `SELECT * FROM bar_verifications ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 1;`
- Expected: New pending verification record

#### 2. Test Email System (Requires Stripe Webhook)

- Trigger a test payment event in Stripe
- Check email logs: `SELECT * FROM email_send_log ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 5;`
- Verify email sent to SendGrid
- Check inbox for test email

#### 3. Accessibility Audit

```bash
# Install Lighthouse CLI (if not installed)
npm install -g @lhci/cli

# Run accessibility audit
lhci autorun --url=https://judgefinder.io

# Expected: Accessibility score > 90
```

#### 4. Browse New Pages Manually

- Visit https://judgefinder.io/attorneys
- Click through to a jurisdiction page
- Visit https://judgefinder.io/case-analytics
- Verify all links work (no 404s)
- Test keyboard navigation (Tab, Enter, Escape)

### Monitoring Checks (24 hours)

#### 1. Sentry Error Tracking

- Open Sentry dashboard
- Check for new errors after deployment
- Expected: No critical errors

#### 2. Performance Metrics

- Open Netlify Analytics
- Check average response times
- Expected: Courts API faster than before (200ms → <100ms cached)

#### 3. Database Monitoring

- Supabase Dashboard → Logs
- Check for RLS policy errors
- Expected: No RLS violations

---

## 🔄 ROLLBACK PROCEDURE

If something goes wrong after deployment:

### Immediate Rollback (Netlify)

1. **Go to Netlify Dashboard** → Deploys
2. **Find previous working deploy** (should be 2nd in list)
3. **Click "..." menu** → "Publish deploy"
4. **Confirm** - Site will revert immediately (30 seconds)

### Database Rollback (If Needed)

If migrations cause issues:

```sql
-- Rollback Migration 2: Drop RLS policies
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Public can read user profiles" ON public.users;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can read own profile" ON public.users;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can update own profile" ON public.users;
-- ... (drop all 32 policies)

-- Rollback Migration 1: Drop bar_verifications table
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS public.bar_verifications CASCADE;
```

**Better Approach:** Keep migrations, but disable features in code:

- Comment out bar verification routes
- Revert email webhook handlers to TODO comments
- Hide new pages with 404 response
