## 📋 NEXT STEPS (CRITICAL - YOU MUST DO)

### 1. **Apply Database Migrations** ⚠️ IN CORRECT ORDER

**⚠️ IMPORTANT:** See [QUICK_FIX_MIGRATION.md](QUICK_FIX_MIGRATION.md) for the correct migration order!

**Open Supabase Dashboard:**

1. Go to https://app.supabase.com
2. Select your JudgeFinder project
3. Click "SQL Editor"

**Apply Migrations in This Order:**

**Step 1 - Base Schema (if not already applied):**

```bash
# Copy and paste from:
supabase/migrations/00000000000000_base_schema_idempotent.sql
```

- Click "Run"
- Expected: "Success" (may show "already exists" warnings - that's OK!)

**Step 2 - Bar Verifications Table:**

```bash
# Copy and paste from:
supabase/migrations/20251024_001_bar_verifications_table.sql
```

- Click "Run"
- Expected: "Success. No rows returned"

**Step 3 - RLS Policies (LAST):**

```bash
# Copy and paste from:
supabase/migrations/20251024_complete_base_schema_rls_policies.sql
```

- Click "Run"
- Expected: "Success. 32 policies created"

**Verify Success:**

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM pg_policies WHERE schemaname = 'public';
-- Should return > 30
```

### 2. **SendGrid** ✅ ALREADY CONFIGURED

**Good News:** SendGrid is already configured in your `.env.local`:

- ✅ `SENDGRID_API_KEY` is set
- ✅ `SENDGRID_FROM_EMAIL=billing@judgefinder.io` is set

**No action needed!** Your email system will work with your existing configuration.

### 3. **Monitor Netlify Deployment**

**Check Build Status:**

1. Go to https://app.netlify.com
2. Click "Deploys" tab
3. Watch for build completion (~3-5 minutes)

**If Build Succeeds:**

- Status changes to "Published"
- Your site is live with all changes! 🎉

**If Build Fails:**

- Click into deploy for error logs
- Common issues:
  - Missing environment variables
  - TypeScript errors (we fixed these locally)
  - Import errors
- Contact me if you see errors

### 4. **Post-Deployment Verification**

**Test New Pages** (should return 200 OK):

```bash
curl -I https://judgefinder.io/attorneys
curl -I https://judgefinder.io/case-analytics
curl -I https://judgefinder.io/legal-research-tools
curl -I https://judgefinder.io/judicial-analytics
```

**Verify API Caching:**

```bash
curl -I https://judgefinder.io/api/courts?jurisdiction=CA | grep Cache
# Should see: Cache-Control: public, s-maxage=3600...
```

**Check Sitemap:**

```bash
curl https://judgefinder.io/sitemap.xml | grep -c "attorneys"
# Should return > 50 (one per jurisdiction)
```

### 5. **24-Hour Monitoring**

**Check These:**

- [ ] Sentry dashboard (no critical errors)
- [ ] Netlify Analytics (response times improved)
- [ ] Supabase Logs (no RLS violations)
- [ ] User feedback (if any)

## 🚨 IF SOMETHING GOES WRONG

### Netlify Build Fails

1. Check build logs in Netlify dashboard
2. Common fixes:
   - Set missing environment variables
   - Check for import errors in logs
   - Verify no syntax errors
3. **Rollback:** Netlify → Deploys → Previous deploy → "Publish deploy"

### Database Migration Issues

1. Check Supabase logs for errors
2. Verify SQL syntax in migration files
3. **Rollback:** Run reverse migration (see docs)
4. Contact support if stuck

### Email System Not Working

1. Verify SendGrid API key is set
2. Check sender email is verified
3. Look at email logs: `SELECT * FROM email_send_log WHERE status = 'failed'`
4. Review error messages

### Performance Issues

1. Check Netlify Edge cache is working
2. Verify caching headers in API responses
3. Review Supabase query performance
4. Check for N+1 query patterns
