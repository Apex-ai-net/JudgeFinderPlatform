## Revenue Streams

5. Potential client conversion for the lawyer

**Example**:
- Judge: Hon. Jane Smith, San Francisco Superior Court, Civil Division
- Advertiser: ABC Law Firm (SF civil litigation specialists)
- Ad Placement: Rotation Slot 1 on Judge Smith's profile
- Cost: $500/month
- Target Audience: People researching Judge Smith (likely have SF civil case)
