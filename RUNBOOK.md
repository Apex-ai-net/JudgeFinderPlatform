# üö® Netlify Secrets Leak Remediation Runbook

**Incident Date:** 2025-10-09
**Repo:** `thefiredev-cloud/JudgeFinderPlatform`
**Severity:** CRITICAL
**Status:** üî¥ Active Incident - Requires Immediate Action

---

## üéØ Executive Summary

**What Happened:**

- Netlify build failed due to secrets scanning detecting `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` in `eslint-report.json`
- Root cause: ESLint generated a report with full source code snapshots containing hardcoded secrets from dev scripts
- **Compromised secrets:**
  - ‚úÖ `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` (JWT token)
  - ‚úÖ Database password (`PGPASSWORD`: `Zhn7BuF6HX5bhSwz`)

**Impact:**

- ‚ö†Ô∏è Service role key grants **admin-level database access**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Database password grants **direct PostgreSQL access**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è If repo is public or accessible to unauthorized users, full database compromise is possible

**Resolution Time Estimate:** 45-60 minutes

---

## ‚ö° Immediate Actions (Next 15 Minutes)

### Step 1: Stop the Bleeding (5 min)

#### 1.1 Verify Repo Visibility

```bash
# Check if repo is public
gh repo view thefiredev-cloud/JudgeFinderPlatform --json visibility

# If public, make private IMMEDIATELY:
gh repo edit thefiredev-cloud/JudgeFinderPlatform --visibility private
```

**Decision:**

- ‚úÖ If repo is already private and access is controlled ‚Üí Continue to Step 1.2
- ‚ùå If repo was public ‚Üí ASSUME FULL COMPROMISE ‚Üí Skip to Step 2 (Rotate Everything)

---

#### 1.2 Delete Exposed Artifact

```bash
cd JudgeFinderPlatform

# Delete eslint-report.json (contains secrets)
rm -f eslint-report.json

# Prevent accidental re-commit
echo "eslint-report.json" >> .gitignore
echo "*-eslint-report.json" >> .gitignore

git add .gitignore eslint-report.json
git commit -m "SECURITY: Remove eslint-report.json containing exposed secrets"
```

---

#### 1.3 Check Build Artifacts on Netlify

```bash
# If you have Netlify CLI:
netlify deploy:list

# Download latest deploy to inspect:
netlify deploy:get <deploy-id> --dir=/tmp/netlify-inspect

# Search for secrets:
cd /tmp/netlify-inspect
grep -r "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9" .
grep -r "Zhn7BuF6HX5bhSwz" .

# If found, DELETE deploy:
netlify deploy:delete <deploy-id>
```

---

### Step 2: Rotate Secrets (10 min)

#### 2.1 Rotate Supabase Service Role Key

**Login to Supabase:**

1. Go to https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. Navigate to: `Project: xstlnicbnzdxlgfiewmg`
3. Click **Settings** ‚Üí **API**

**Rotate the Key:**

1. Under "Service Role Key (secret)", click **"Regenerate"**
2. Confirm the action
3. **Copy the new key** (you only see it once!)

**Update in Netlify:**

```bash
# Via Netlify UI:
# 1. Site Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables
# 2. Find SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY
# 3. Edit ‚Üí Paste new key ‚Üí Save

# Or via CLI:
netlify env:set SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY "your-new-key-here"
```

**Update Locally:**

```bash
# Edit .env.local
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-new-key-here
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL:** The old key is now **revoked**. Any running processes using it will fail.

---

#### 2.2 Rotate Database Password

**Connect to Supabase Dashboard:**

1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/xstlnicbnzdxlgfiewmg/settings/database
2. Scroll to "Database Password"

**Reset Password:**

1. Click **"Reset Database Password"**
2. Confirm action
3. **Copy new password immediately**

**Update in Netlify:**

```bash
# Update DATABASE_URL with new password
netlify env:set DATABASE_URL "postgresql://postgres.xstlnicbnzdxlgfiewmg:<NEW_PASSWORD>@aws-0-us-west-1.pooler.supabase.com:6543/postgres"

# Update PGPASSWORD
netlify env:set PGPASSWORD "<NEW_PASSWORD>"
```

**Update Locally:**

```bash
# Edit .env.local
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres.xstlnicbnzdxlgfiewmg:<NEW_PASSWORD>@aws-0-us-west-1.pooler.supabase.com:6543/postgres
PGPASSWORD=<NEW_PASSWORD>
```

---

#### 2.3 Invalidate Active Sessions (Optional but Recommended)

**If you suspect active malicious sessions:**

1. Go to Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí **Authentication** ‚Üí **Users**
2. Click "Sign out all users" (forces re-auth with new credentials)

**Alternatively, via SQL:**

```sql
-- Connect to Supabase SQL Editor
-- Run this to invalidate all refresh tokens:
DELETE FROM auth.refresh_tokens;
```

---

## üîß Code Fixes (Next 20 Minutes)

### Step 3: Apply Code Patches

#### 3.1 Apply Main Fix Patch

```bash
cd JudgeFinderPlatform

# Review the patch first
cat fix.patch

# Apply the patch
patch -p1 < fix.patch

# Or manually apply changes:
# - Delete eslint-report.json (already done in Step 1.2)
# - Update .gitignore (add eslint-report.json)
# - Update .netlifyignore (add eslint-report.json)
# - Update package.json ("lint" script ‚Üí add --format=stylish)
# - Guard dev scripts with CI check
```

#### 3.2 Update Netlify Configuration

```bash
# Review the diff
cat netlify.toml.diff

# Apply manually (patch may not work on TOML):
# 1. Change NPM_FLAGS to remove --include=dev
# 2. Update SECRETS_SCAN_OMIT_PATHS to be more restrictive
# 3. Add CI=true to all build contexts
```

**Edit `netlify.toml`:**

```toml
[build.environment]
  NODE_VERSION = "20"
  NPM_FLAGS = "--legacy-peer-deps"  # REMOVED: --include=dev
  NODE_ENV = "production"
  CI = "true"  # NEW: Enables script guards

  # More restrictive scanning
  SECRETS_SCAN_OMIT_PATHS = ".netlify/cache/**,.next/cache/**,node_modules/**,.git/**"
  SECRETS_SCAN_OMIT_KEYS = "NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_AFTER_SIGN_IN_URL,NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_UP_URL,NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_NAME,NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_AFTER_SIGN_UP_URL,NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_IN_URL,NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL,NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL,NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL,NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY,ADMIN_USER_IDS"

[context.production.environment]
  NODE_ENV = "production"
  CI = "true"

[context.deploy-preview.environment]
  NODE_ENV = "production"
  CI = "true"

[context.branch-deploy.environment]
  NODE_ENV = "development"
  CI = "true"
```

#### 3.3 Verify Script Guards

**Check that all dev scripts have CI guards:**

```bash
# Check analyze-db-direct.js
grep -A3 "if (process.env.CI)" scripts/analyze-db-direct.js

# Expected output:
# if (process.env.CI) {
#   console.error('‚ùå This script cannot run in CI environments')
#   process.exit(1)
# }

# Repeat for:
# - scripts/analyze-migration-state.js
# - scripts/apply-search-fix-migration.js
# - scripts/check-schema.js
```

If guards are missing, add them:

```javascript
// At the top of each script, after imports:

// SECURITY: This script is for LOCAL DEVELOPMENT ONLY
if (process.env.CI) {
  console.error('‚ùå This script cannot run in CI environments for security reasons.')
  process.exit(1)
}
```

#### 3.4 Update scripts/check-schema.js

**Replace hardcoded connection string with env var:**

```javascript
// OLD (INSECURE):
const client = new Client({
  connectionString:
    'postgresql://postgres.xstlnicbnzdxlgfiewmg:' +
    'eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...' +
    '@aws-0-us-west-1.pooler.supabase.com:6543/postgres',
  ssl: { rejectUnauthorized: false },
})

// NEW (SECURE):
if (!process.env.DATABASE_URL) {
  console.error('‚ùå DATABASE_URL environment variable required')
  process.exit(1)
}

const client = new Client({
  connectionString: process.env.DATABASE_URL,
  ssl: { rejectUnauthorized: false },
})
```

#### 3.5 Commit Changes

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "SECURITY: Implement secrets leak remediation

- Delete eslint-report.json (contained exposed service role key)
- Add eslint-report.json to .gitignore and .netlifyignore
- Update netlify.toml to prevent dev tools in CI
- Add CI guards to dev scripts
- Refactor check-schema.js to use DATABASE_URL env var

## üßπ Git History Cleanup (Next 15 Minutes)

**‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING:** This rewrites git history. All commit SHAs will change.

### Step 4: Scrub Secrets from History

#### 4.1 Run History Scrub Script

```bash
# Make script executable
chmod +x history-scrub.sh

# Review what it will do
cat history-scrub.sh

# Run it (will prompt for confirmation)
./history-scrub.sh
```

**The script will:**

1. Create a backup of your repo
2. Remove `eslint-report.json` from ALL history
3. Replace secret strings with `***REMOVED***` placeholders
4. Force garbage collection
5. Verify secrets are gone

#### 4.2 Force Push to Remote

**‚ö†Ô∏è THIS IS DESTRUCTIVE - Coordinate with your team first!**

```bash
# Notify team members in Slack/Discord BEFORE pushing:
# "üö® URGENT: I'm force-pushing to remove secrets from git history.
#  After I push, you MUST re-clone the repo. Do NOT pull or merge.
#  I'll let you know when it's safe to continue."

# Force push
git push origin --all --force
git push origin --tags --force

# Notify team:
# "‚úÖ Force push complete. Delete your local repo and re-clone:
#  rm -rf JudgeFinderPlatform && git clone <repo-url>"
```

- [x] Update `netlify.toml` configuration
- [x] Scrub secrets from git history
- [x] Force push to remote
- [x] Verify Netlify build passes

---

### Short-term (Next 24 Hours)

- [ ] **Audit logs:** Check Supabase logs for unauthorized access

  ```bash
  # Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí Logs ‚Üí Database
  # Look for queries from unknown IPs or unusual patterns
  ```

- [ ] **Review access logs:** Check who cloned/accessed the repo recently

  ```bash
  gh api repos/thefiredev-cloud/JudgeFinderPlatform/traffic/clones
  gh api repos/thefiredev-cloud/JudgeFinderPlatform/traffic/views
  ```

- [ ] **Scan for leaked secrets on GitHub:** Use GitHub secret scanning

  ```bash
  # Go to: https://github.com/thefiredev-cloud/JudgeFinderPlatform/security/secret-scanning
  # Verify no alerts exist
  ```

- [ ] **Check for leaked secrets on web:** Use GitGuardian or TruffleHog

  ```bash
  # Install trufflehog:
  docker run -it -v "$PWD:/pwd" trufflesecurity/trufflehog:latest github --repo https://github.com/thefiredev-cloud/JudgeFinderPlatform

  # Expected: No secrets found
  ```

- [ ] **Notify stakeholders:** Inform team/clients if data may have been compromised
  - Draft template email available in section below

---

### Medium-term (Next Week)

- [ ] **Implement secrets management:** Migrate to a secrets manager
  - Options: Doppler, 1Password Secrets Automation, AWS Secrets Manager
  - Rationale: Centralized rotation, audit logs, access control

- [ ] **Add pre-commit hooks:** Prevent secrets from being committed

  ```bash
  npm install --save-dev @commitlint/cli husky lint-staged
  # Configure husky to run git-secrets or gitleaks on pre-commit
  ```

- [ ] **Enable GitHub secret push protection:**

  ```bash
  # Go to: https://github.com/thefiredev-cloud/JudgeFinderPlatform/settings/security_analysis
  # Enable "Secret scanning" and "Push protection"
  ```

- [ ] **Set up monitoring:** Alert on suspicious database activity
  - Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Webhooks
  - Configure alerts for:
    - Large data exports
    - Unusual query patterns
    - Failed authentication attempts

- [ ] **Conduct security training:** Educate team on secrets management
  - Topics: .env files, git history, API key rotation, CI/CD security

---

### Long-term (Next Month)

- [ ] **Implement least privilege:** Create role-specific API keys
  - Instead of service_role for everything, create:
    - `analytics_service` (read-only on analytics tables)
    - `sync_service` (write access to sync tables only)
    - `admin_service` (full access, used only by trusted admins)

- [ ] **Rotate all secrets quarterly:** Schedule regular rotations
  - Set calendar reminders for every 90 days
  - Document rotation process in team wiki

- [ ] **Automate secret rotation:** Use Terraform or Pulumi
  - Example:
    ```hcl
    resource "supabase_api_key" "service_role" {
      project_id = var.project_id
      name       = "service_role"
      scopes     = ["all"]
      rotation_days = 90
    }
    ```

- [ ] **Conduct penetration test:** Hire security firm to audit
  - Focus areas: API security, database access control, secrets management

## üîç Forensics (If Breach is Suspected)

### Signs of Compromise

Check for these indicators:

1. **Unusual database queries:**

   ```sql
   -- In Supabase SQL Editor:
   SELECT * FROM auth.audit_log_entries
   WHERE created_at > '2025-10-08'  -- Adjust to incident date
   ORDER BY created_at DESC;
   ```

2. **Large data exports:**

   ```sql
   -- Check for bulk SELECT queries
   SELECT * FROM pg_stat_statements
   WHERE query LIKE '%SELECT%FROM%'
   ORDER BY total_exec_time DESC
   LIMIT 50;
   ```

3. **Failed authentication attempts:**

   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM auth.audit_log_entries
   WHERE action = 'login'
   AND payload->>'success' = 'false'
   AND created_at > '2025-10-08';
   ```

4. **Data modifications:**
   ```sql
   -- Check for unexpected inserts/updates/deletes
   SELECT schemaname, tablename, n_tup_ins, n_tup_upd, n_tup_del
   FROM pg_stat_user_tables
   ORDER BY n_tup_del DESC;
   ```

### If Breach Confirmed

1. **Isolate the database:**
   - Change all passwords immediately
   - Revoke all API keys
   - Enable IP allowlisting (Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Database ‚Üí Network Restrictions)

2. **Preserve evidence:**
   - Export all logs from Supabase
   - Download git history before scrubbing
   - Save Netlify build logs

3. **Notify authorities:** Depending on jurisdiction and data sensitivity:
   - GDPR: Notify supervisory authority within 72 hours
   - CCPA: Notify California AG if >500 residents affected
   - HIPAA: Notify HHS if PHI involved

4. **Engage incident response firm:**
   - Contact: Mandiant, CrowdStrike, or local MSSP
   - They will conduct forensics and containment
