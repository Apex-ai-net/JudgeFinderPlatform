## Development Guidelines

- Only modify code directly relevant to the specific request. Avoid changing unrelated functionality.
- Never replace code with placeholders like `# ... rest of the processing ...`. Always include complete code.
- Break problems into smaller steps. Think through each step separately before implementing.
- Always provide a complete PLAN with REASONING based on evidence from code and logs before making changes.
- Explain your OBSERVATIONS clearly, then provide REASONING to identify the exact issue. Add console logs when needed to gather more information.

- Court system topology maintenance

## Legal Search Intelligence (Importance: 85)
lib/ai/search-intelligence.ts
- Domain-specific entity recognition
- Legal taxonomy classification
- Practice area categorization
- Judge specialization matching

## Data Synchronization System (Importance: 80)
lib/sync/decision-sync.ts
- Multi-source judicial data integration
- Court opinion processing
- Case outcome classification
- Decision document analysis

## Advertising Platform (Importance: 75)
lib/ads/service.ts
- Court hierarchy-based pricing
- Judge prominence scoring

- Professional verification

Key Integration Points:
1. Analytics feeds bias detection system
2. Court relationships inform ad placement
3. Search system leverages judge analytics
4. Sync system maintains data quality
5. Ad platform respects jurisdiction rules

Core Data Flows:
1. Court opinions → Analytics engine
2. Judge assignments → Court relationships
3. Search queries → Entity recognition
4. External sources → Sync system
5. Ad placement → Court hierarchy

This architecture demonstrates tight coupling between judicial data processing, court relationship management, and legal domain search functionality, with specialized handling of jurisdiction hierarchies and legal professional advertising.
